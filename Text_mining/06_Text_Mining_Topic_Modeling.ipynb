Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\\n\\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\\n\\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\\n\\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\\n\\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\\ndon\\'t. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\\n\\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\\nachieve a good result.\\n\\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\\n\\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he\\'s\\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\\n\\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\\nthought.\\n\\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\\n\\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\\n\\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph\\'s ten older brothers,\\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\\n\\n\\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\\n   and of Judaism.\\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\\n   the Promised Land.\\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\\n   of all humans everywhere.\\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\\n   saved them.\\n\\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity\\'s sake.]\\n\\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\\n   memorable line of the evening.\\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph\\'s brothers, and continuing\\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\\n   Epiphanes....\\n\\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren\\'t\\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\\nstate of Israel.\\n\\nSomeone hearing the rabbi\\'s lecture might leap to the conclusion\\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God\\'s doing -- that He\\nstirred up Joseph\\'s brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh\\'s\\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\\nbrought about.\\n\\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph\\'s brothers had not sold him, God\\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas\\' sin to redeem us. If\\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\\nand had attacked Fisher\\'s knight instead (don\\'t bother to look up\\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\\nnone the less valid).\\n\\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\\nwas not God\\'s doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God\\'s\\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\\n\\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\\nwill harden Pharaoh\\'s heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\\n\\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\\ninstruments of God\\'s will?\\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\\nJoseph\\'s brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\\npunishment.\\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.',\n",

              "  \"Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's \\n\\tContest Announcement)\\n\\nWHAT IS ACCESS.bus?\\n\\nACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer \\nperipheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \\nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \\na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \\nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \\ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \\nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \\nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \\nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \\ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \\nPlug and Play on every PC.\\n\\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \\nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \\ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \\nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \\ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\\nplatform use of the same device.\\n\\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\\n=====================================\\n\\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \\nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \\nfee or royalty.\\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \\nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \\ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\\n\\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \\nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \\nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \\nsynchronization.  \\n\\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \\nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\\n\\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \\narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \\nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \\ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \\nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \\nreceiver.  \\n\\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \\na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \\nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \\nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \\nadditional semantics, including checksum.\\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \\nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \\naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \\nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \\nsystem is running, without rebooting.\\n\\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \\nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \\ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \\nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \\nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\\n\\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \\nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \\nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \\nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \\n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \\nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \\nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \\nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \\nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\\n\\n\\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\",\n",

They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and\\n   anachronisms.\\n   2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices\\n   which are at variance with sacred Scripture.\\n   3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\\n   subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\\n   4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\\n   Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\\n   poetic and religious feeling.\\n\\nFirst, to point out the obvious: While #4 would clearly be a highly\\nsubjective issue, one would be hard pressed to point to another book\\nof the OT (or for that matter the NT) that doesn't, on some issues, in\\nsome way, fail one or more of the first three of these tests.\\n\\nSecond, one factor the Deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of\\ntheir composition.  I don't recall the exact dating of all of the\\nbooks, but most --if not all-- were written after the latest of the\\ncanonical books (i.e. Daniel).\\n\\nFurthermore, while the Deuterocanonical may or may not have been\\noriginally written in Greek, they are clearly deeply _Hellenistic_ in\\nnature.  Both of these features probably figured heavily in the\\nrejection of these books from the various canons.\\n\\nThese may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to\\njudge the canonicity of these books, but, as these discussions have\\nshown, I think the one thing we can see is that there _are_ no purely\\nobjective standards for determining canonicity.\",\n",

There is only one way of determin-\\ning \"best\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at\\nthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best\\nthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\\n\\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\nsolutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B\\nin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\\n\\nIf you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has\\ndone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you\\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\\nindividual\\'s  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\\nonly measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\\njective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can\\npredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\\n\\n\\nExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with\\nClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.\\nI am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally\\nmeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on\\nhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to be rude.\\n\\n\\nFor you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point\\nof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio\\nElenchi.

I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\\nindividual\\'s  performance   from that of his team\\'s for the purpose of\\ncomparing that individual\\'s performance with another individual\\'s per-\\nformance.\\n\\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that\\'s  about  it.

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable.

              "  'LISTOWNER: I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately. Post it only\\nif you think it of general interest.\\n\\nHere is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may\\nfind it relevant.\\n\\nA listmember asks:\\n\\n > What makes common-law marriages wrong?\\n\\nA common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is\\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish\\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\\n\\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\\nclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the\\nWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,\\nand that the clergyman is there only as a witness.\\n\\nHOWEVER!\\n\\nThe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two\\npersons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound\\nthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,\\nforsaking all others, till death do them part.\\n\\n      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who\\nis married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public\\nceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be\\nclear about whether a commitment has been made.\\n\\nSuppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,\\netc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live\\ntogether.\\n      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it\\nwas great while it lasted, but I think it\\'s time to move on.\\nyounger.\\nocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,\\nutterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble\\nbreath will utter your name. My...\"\\nman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly\\nthings like that. You mustn\\'t take them literally.\\n\\nAnd that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is\\na matter of public record.\\n      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other\\nthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice\\nabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married\\nto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.\\n      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with\\nproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to\\nknow who has made what commitments to whom.\\n      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don\\'t\\nwant their daughters seduced and abandoned.\\n      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make\\nsure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,\\nor just \"poetry.\"\\n      And persons making vows themselves insist on making them\\nformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own\\nminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves\\nthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.\\n\\n      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the\\nmarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when\\nChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and\\nrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is\\nimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order\\nto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching\\nabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married\\nin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage\\nvow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much\\nthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they\\ndraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly\\nused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.\\nTry to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that\\nthe probate judge\\'s interpretation of them is not at all what you\\nintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates\\nabout whether \"You are my main squeeze\" and \"I am here for the long\\nhaul\" do in fact cover the same territory as \"forsaking all others\"\\nand \"till death do us part.\"\\n\\n      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic\\nthat hasn\\'t?) One listmember was asking, \"If a couple love each\\nother and are living together, isn\\'t that marriage in the eyes of\\nGod?\" Eventually someone asked, \"In that case, what is their status\\nif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?\\nAre they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk\\nof that!\" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\\nsomeone who says, \"We don\\'t need a piece of paper or a ceremony in\\nfront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each\\nother,\" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of\\nmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of\\nbother.\\n\\nAt this point someone may say, \"None of this applies to me and my\\nmate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong\\ncommitment, \\'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death\\nus do part.\\' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.\"\\n     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver\\'s\\nlicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in\\nitself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence\\nof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an\\nobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the\\nnumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly\\nmakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive\\nmoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter\\nhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.\\n\\nBack to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a\\ncouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:\\nAt what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I\\nanswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and\\nexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for\\nbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted\\nsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to\\ndeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?',\n",

We use it to\\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\\nvideo to the Net.\\n\\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\\'ve ever\\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\\'ll recognize the methodology\\nand the user interface.\\n\\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\\n\\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.

I am not recommending any one\\ndenommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian\\ncongregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just\\nreading the Bible.\\n\\tThis does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although\\nI would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the\\nBook of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are\\ncomfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to\\nread the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable\\nlack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really\\nsturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.\\n\\tThe point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith\\nof Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital\\nbeliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -\\nthe Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church\\norganization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the\\nlived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one\\nhopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies\\nin the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.\\n\\tFollowing up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I \\nwould even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the\\nchristian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing\\nthe nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into\\nthe christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading\\nGraham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard\\nManley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene\\'s _Monsignor\\nQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,\\nbut such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,\\nI often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after\\nreading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being\\na Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in\\nsome way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by\\nthe person of Jesus Christ.',\n",

              "  'The ONLY unity I\\'ve found which is true is when all parties involved are\\ndisciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different\\ncongregations were always competing and arguing about which one was\\nbetter and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything\\ninto practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I\\'ve\\nfound that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they\\nare just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in\\nJanuary when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this\\nretreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even\\nthe people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple\\nthe previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One\\nof the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only\\none area in which disciples stand out from \"Christians\".  Also, another\\npart of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I\\'ve also been a part of\\nsome \"Christian\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between\\nchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of\\nconviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be\\nunified, they didn\\'t care about the truth but delighted in getting along\\ntogether.\\n\\nCreeds?  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly\\nbetter?\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going\\nto be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those\\nwho teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion\\nand belief.  However, Scripture states:  \\n   In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your\\nmeetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when\\nyou come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some\\nextent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to\\nshow which of you have God\\'s approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).\\n\\nHow will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but\\nbefore that, there are these qualities:\\n   devotion to the apostles teaching\\n   fellowship\\n   communion\\n   filling with awe for God\\n   all having everything in common.\\n   glad and sincere hearts\\n   praising God\\n   enjoying the favor of the people\\nAll these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who\\nhave these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \"a man full of\\nfaith and of the Holy Spirit\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts\\n7:54-60).  \\n\\n\\nOne can say that a church is the true church only if that church is\\nperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I\\nhave yet to find that, but the closest one I\\'ve found is the Boston\\nChurch of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors\\npointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I\\'ve seen which is\\ntotally sold out to God.\\n\\nAs for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may\\nnever occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the\\n\"true one\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are\\ndisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they\\nwill not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I\\'ve heard\\nnumerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there\\nthat are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them\\nany less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they\\'ve ever run\\ninto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.\\nI know I haven\\'t.\\n\\nI must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which\\nruns around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems\\nin fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is\\nsomething \"correct\" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of\\nthe churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of\\npeople who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational\\nheads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of\\nthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without another\\noffice being \"opened up\" so that they would have to step right back in.\\nTheir degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he\\nnearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he\\nwould\\'ve since they still have no clue about what it means to be a\\ndisciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be\\nbroken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division\\nwithin.  There\\'s enough division without.\\n',\n",

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

I\\'ve been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \\nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \\n\\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \\nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \\ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \\ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ\\' and \\n`Christian\\'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \\nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \\nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \\nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \\nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \\nriches of knowing Christ.\\n\\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \\nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \\nthey had decided it wasn\\'t a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \\ndidn\\'t disown me but they didn\\'t completely accept the situation either.  \\nFor example, they didn\\'t come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \\nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \\ndeath, she said to me, \"As far as I\\'m concerned, you still are a Jew.\" \\nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \\nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I\\'ll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \\nmatzoh balls.:-)) \\n\\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \\nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \\ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \\nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\\n\\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \\nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \\nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \\n\\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \\nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \\na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \\nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \\nand do not want to ask for it back.\\n\\nAnd while I don\\'t have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \\nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \\nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \\nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \\nbeing rooted in the past. \\n\\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don\\'t like it when people mess \\naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \\nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\\n\\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn\\'t assume that all \\nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.

              "  '\\nI strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation.\\nThat\\'s because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like\\nso many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.\\n\\nI strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I\\ndeign from commenting much further.\\n\\n\\nNow hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as\\nmany other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that\\nChristians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if\\nyou believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily\\nbeing arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,\\nbut he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.\\n \\n\\nNot quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*\\ndetermine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible\\nhuman beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The \\ndistinction is subtle yet important.\\n\\nWhen a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results\\nare reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could\\nhave been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,\\nwithout sacrificing his convictions.\\n\\nNobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.\\nThroughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know\\nwith complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the\\nright direction when he uttered, \"Cogito, ergo sum,\" yet we have not advanced\\nmuch beyond that.\\n\\nDo you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that\\nthe computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely\\ncertain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,\\nyou have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all\\npractical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with\\nChristianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about\\nabsolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability \\nthat they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) \\nabandon these absolutes.\\n\\n\\nAs I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does\\nnot mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to \\nrender all doubts unreasonable.\\n',\n",

A mind is not a mind without a\\nwill.  I know this has been dealt with in past Church prnouncements, but there\\nis a philosophical problem here that should examined.\\n\\nT. V.

The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from\\nthe field of psychology, and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream, seeing\\nyourself acting, knowing that is you, but also being omniscient.  \\n\\nThe one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds.

If you take the few passages that could possibly\\nbe interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And\\nthere are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-\\ntion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.\\n\\nWe can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that\\nmight have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.\\nBut what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach\\nto the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist\\nand \"new age\" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular\\nincarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ\\nas the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for\\nhis deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;\\nthe redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of\\nthe body, and the Last Judgement.\\n\\nTaken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely\\ndifferent perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their\\nsins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to \\nworks, the meaning of \"deathbed conversion\", the meaning of the\\nsacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all\\nthose questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that\\nthe discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion\\none that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and \\nRedeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such \\nas the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian\\ndoctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.\\n\\nThere are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible \\ndoes not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ\\nalso indicated that there were other things that we would come to know\\nin the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) \\ncould not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in\\nknowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole\\nof humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth\\nin the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify\\nall spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel\\nof the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the\\ngreater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, \\nnot the end of man\\'s sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and\\nthe New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.',\n",

It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that\\none of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of\\nthe nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume\\nthat the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one-\\ndimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds\\nblow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's\\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \\nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\\n\\nTo quote from H.S.

Furthermore, the Church\\nhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say\\nthat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free\\nwill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also\\naffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and\\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \\nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those\\nwithout that grace can\\'t be saved, it just means that god foreknew their\\nobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need\\nit, as they had freely chosen hell.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^\\nPeople who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own\\neffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined\\nthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish\\nbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were\\ndeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and\\nsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.\\n\\n\\nWell, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some\\nblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),\\nfor those He can\\'t bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And\\nthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one\\nor in Purgatory for their sins.

Brown Associates.\\n\\n------\\n\\nDenali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics\\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use\\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both\\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\\npixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly\\nin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have \\nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\\npenetration.\\n\\nThere remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and\\nE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end\\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\\nflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to\\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\\na higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom\\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom\\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\\napplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and\\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note\\nthat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not\\nrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,\\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\\n\\nThe KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.\\nEntry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\\nFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\\npoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because\\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide\\nstrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that\\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's\\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\\nthem separately as needed.\\n\\nBoth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive\\nVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide\\nthis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali\\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.\\nAside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism\\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\\ndata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation\\nmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\\nto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking\\ntexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable\\nsolution.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\nBrian\",\n",

Smith, D.D.\\n                              (1894-1977)\\n\\n          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about\\n     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:\\n\\n                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son\\n               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief\\n               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall\\n               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him\\n               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and\\n               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall\\n               rise again\" (Matthew 20:18-19).\\n\\n          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,\\n     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving\\n     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He\\n     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious\\n     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that\\n     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual\\n     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly\\n     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*\\n\\n          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the\\n     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted\\n     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise\\n     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.\\n\\n          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-\\n     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-\\n     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.\\n\\n          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth\\n     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and\\n     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which\\n     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against\\n     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had\\n     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and\\n     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the\\n     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some\\n     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the\\n     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,\\n     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back\\n     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus\\' friends, Peter and\\n     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the\\n     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came\\n     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them\\n     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).\\n\\n          How did this tomb become empty?\\n\\n          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--\\n     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological\\n     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*\\n     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by\\n     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb\\n     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the\\n     chimney at Christmas time.\\n\\n          But he didn\\'t realize that Santa Clause never did come down\\n     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa\\n     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the\\n     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.\\n\\n          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-\\n     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by\\n     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.\\n\\n          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,\\n     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar\\n     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)\\n     that the women went to the wrong tomb.\\n\\n          The facts are these:\\n\\n          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to\\n     which by mistake they could have gone.\\n\\n          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or\\n     more people to forget the place where they have buried their\\n     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women\\n     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to\\n     the wrong tomb?\\n\\n          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?\\n\\n          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the\\n     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.\\n\\n                  Now when they were going, behold, some\\n               of the watch came into the city and showed\\n               unto the chief priests all the things that\\n               were done.  And when they were assembled\\n               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they\\n               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,\\n               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole\\n               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to\\n               the governor\\'s ears, we will persuade him, and\\n               secure you.  So they took the money, and did\\n               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-\\n               monly reported among the Jews until this day\\n               (Matthew 28:11-15).\\n\\n          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the\\n     fact that the tomb was empty.\\n\\n          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never\\n     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to\\n     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.\\n\\n          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that\\n     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus\\' disciples\\n     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*\\n\\n          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?\\n     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.\\n\\n          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject\\n     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the\\n     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away\\n     the body of Jesus.\\n\\n          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in\\n     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to\\n     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His\\n     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there\\n     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,\\n     then proved.\\n\\n          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would\\n     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.\\n     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most\\n     of these men did.\\n\\n          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ\\n     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it\\n     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed\\n     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing\\n     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today\\n     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.\\n\\n          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to\\n     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to\\n     what had happened to Him.\\n\\n          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.\\n\\n          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning\\n     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-\\n     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He\\n     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that\\n     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper\\n     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).\\n\\n          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at\\n     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren\\n     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the\\n     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-\\n     8).\\n\\n          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-\\n     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed\\n     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are\\n     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the\\n     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the\\n     appearances.\\n\\n          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our\\n     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are\\n     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest\\n     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.\\n     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;\\n     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of\\n     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president\\n     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.\\n\\n          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has\\n     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:\\n     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.\\n\\n          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He\\n     claimed to have come down *from* God.\\n\\n          He said He was the way *to* God.\\n\\n          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.\\n\\n          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one\\n     else had it.\\n\\n          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to\\n     us.\\n\\n          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed\\n     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*\\n\\n          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe\\n     that His words are all true?\\n\\n          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us\\n     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?\\n\\n          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead\\n     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some\\n     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.\\n\\n          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all\\n     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For\\n     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-\\n     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a\\n     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.',\n",

              "  '\\n\\nWell, here is something I wrote some time ago in response to a\\nsimilar question.  I hope it helps:\\n\\n[Begin repeat of previous post]\\n\\nAs for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a \\nproblem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general.  \\nLuke\\'s version has Jesus saying that the children of this world \\nmarry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain\\nthe kingdom of heaven.  It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies\\none for salvation.  (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.)   I\\nthink the accounts are not as clear as they might be.  Let\\'s have a\\nlook at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable\\nideas of what it means.  The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30,\\nMark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36.\\n\\nWhat happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in the\\nresurrection, thought they could trap Jesus.  They made reference to\\nthe \"Leverite\" marriage which required the brother of a man who died\\nwithout children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.  \\nThe children would be considered children of the deceased, just as\\nthough the woman\\'s first husband had fathered them.  It seems\\nobvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be\\nthe wife of her first husband.  However, the Sadducees concocted a\\nscene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to\\nfather children by the widow.  They seem to imply that the Leverite\\nmarriage was equal to the first for they ask, \"Whose wife shall she\\nbe in the resurrection?\"  At this point it seems obvious that if she\\nis anybody\\'s wife, it is the first husband.  After all, had she\\nborne children they would have been credited to him regardless of\\nwhich brother was the biological father.  It is possible Jesus was\\nrefering to this when he says, \"Ye do err, not knowing the\\nscriptures or the power of God.\" (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24,\\nphrase not in Luke\\'s account).\\n\\nAnyway, the Sadducees ask, \"Whose wife will she be in the\\nresurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?\"  Jesus answer is that,\\n\"In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in\\nmarriage...\" (Mat 22:30) \"When they rise from the dead they neither\\nmarry...\" (Mark 12:25)  \"They which are accounted worthy to obtain\\nthat world neither marry...\" (Luke 20:35)  All 3 accounts go on to\\nsay, \"but are as the angels in heaven\" or the equivalent.  I find\\nthis last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels\\nnor give any idea what their life is like.

I know, I am\\nquite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches\\nto participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very\\nuncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly\\ninfluenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.\\n(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both\\npreferences have their place in the Body).\\n\\nMaybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words\\nare usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert\\nscale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is\\nexcerpted from my summary:\\n\\n1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:\\n\\n        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside\\n                          world of people, activities or things.\\n\\n        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal\\n                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.\\n\\n\\nHopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can\\nstructure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise\\nthe Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities\\nto fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects\\nof how churches have not properly understood personality variances among\\ntheir members to the detriment of all.\\n\\nJon Noring\\n\\n-- \\n\\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\",\n",

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,\\n    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has\\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n',\n",

Jesus\\'s enemies *would not* have stolen His\\n                body because that would have perpetrated the\\n                resurrection--the very opposite of what they\\n                desired.\\n\\n            2.  Jesus\\' disciples *could not* have stolen His\\n                body because Pontius Pilate established guards\\n                to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be\\n                stolen.\\n\\n            3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus\\' disciples\\n                did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus\\n                had risen from the dead.\\n\\n            4.

There is another\\nentry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They\\ncan be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as\\npub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far\\nmore detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though\\nprimarily from a conservative point of view.\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThis posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and\\nChristians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the\\nquestion each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize\\nthe postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes\\narguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people\\nasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most\\ncommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is \"how can a\\nChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about\\nit?\"\\n\\nFirst, on the definition of \\'homosexual\\'.  Many groups believe that\\nthere is a homosexual \"orientation\", i.e. a sexual attraction to\\nmembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual\\nsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by\\nmost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the\\nterm \\'homosexual\\' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.\\nThis is generally not accepted outside the most \\'liberal\\' groups.  In\\nthis paper I\\'m going to use \\'homosexual\\' as meaning a person engaging\\nin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven\\'t heard of any\\nBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who\\nremains celebate.\\n\\nI think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be\\nhomosexual.  This is often called a \\'homosexual orientation\\'.  It is\\nnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence\\nsuggesting each.  The best evidence I\\'ve seen is that homosexuality is\\nnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of\\nthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help\\npeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is\\nExodus International\".  The reports I\\'ve seen (and I haven\\'t read the\\ndetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the\\nPresbyterian Church\\'s infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that\\nthese programs have very low success rates, and that there are\\nquestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly\\nare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as\\nimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong\\nbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact\\nthat it\\'s hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant\\nthan the fact that it\\'s hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If\\nit\\'s wrong, it\\'s wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.\\nIf it\\'s very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more\\nwilling to forgive it.\\n\\nOne more general background issue: It\\'s common to quote a figure that\\n10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where\\nthis came from.  Here\\'s his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source\\nof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by\\norientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely\\nheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,\\none-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of\\norgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have\\nmost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The\\npercentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey\\nInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not published\\nuntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can\\'t\\nput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online\\ninformation for Kinsey\\'s own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog\\nat Rutgers:\\n   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.\\n    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

A\\njournalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting\\nher book that allegedly refutes Kinsey\\'s study, but the scholarly\\nworld seems to take her for a kook......\\n\\nI\\'ve seen some objections to the Kinsey\\'s study, but not in enough\\ndetail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another\\nview, I\\'d be willing to include it.)\\n\\nMost Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.\\nNot all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan\\nCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to\\naccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows\\nit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal\\nChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that\\nhave congregational government, you\\'ll find a few congregations that\\naccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably\\nonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches\\npermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is\\nanother issue.  I don\\'t have any doubt that there are homosexual\\npastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.\\n\\nAs to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here\\'s an\\nattempt to summarize the issues:\\n\\nThe most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of\\nhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:\\n\"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\", U Chicago Press,\\n1980.\\n\\nThe argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws\\nin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on\\nhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some\\npassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.\\nthe sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was\\nhomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.\\n(There\\'s even some question whether it was homosexual, since the\\nentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying\\nbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in\\nthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot\\noffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to\\nallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance\\nfor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you\\'ll see that few\\nseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There\\'s a Jewish\\ninterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any\\nrate, there\\'s no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.\\n\\nI do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set\\nof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT\\njustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.\\n\\nThe NT references are all in Paul\\'s letters.  A number of the\\nreferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly\\nvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not\\nin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and\\n/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words\\nactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety\\nof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests\\n\"wanton\" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous\\ninterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was\\nthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has\\nvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less\\nfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the\\nCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He\\ntranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none\\nof the church fathers understood the term as referring to\\nhomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the\\nearly Latin translations, would be \"active mode homosexual male\\nprostitute\", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.\\n\\nFor a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee\\'s commentary on I\\nCor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.\\nHowever Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not\\nnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated\\nwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee\\nsay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very\\ndefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it\\nisn\\'t a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against\\nBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a\\ntranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it\\nis that the word is almost never used.  Paul\\'s writing is the first\\noccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of \"male\" and\\n\"f**k\" unfortunately doesn\\'t quite tell us the meaning, since it\\ndoesn\\'t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the\\naction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.\\nIn theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It\\'s dangerous to base\\nmeaning purely on etymology, or you\\'ll conclude that \"goodbye\" is a\\nreligious expression because it\\'s based on \"God by with ye\".  However\\nsince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on \"homosexual male\\nprostitute\", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this\\ntranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something\\nwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in\\ntheir translation).\\n\\nIn my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans\\n1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something\\nthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result\\nof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue\\nthat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false\\ngods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become\\nheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in\\nfact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is\\nwhat Paul meant.\\n\\nHowever I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law\\nagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom\\n1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it\\'s homosexuality that\\nappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.\\nDespite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I\\'m sure Paul\\ndoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.\\nGiven his description of their situation, I rather assume that their\\nheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do\\nbelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.\\nBut in all fairness, the \"shameless\" nature of their acts is a\\nreflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a\\nspecific feature of homosexuality.\\n\\nMy overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have\\nenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of\\nhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are\\nnot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do\\nnot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of\\nhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\\nother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\\nsubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\\nin passing.\\n\\nThe result of this situation is that people interpret these passages\\nin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look\\nto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising\\nthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT\\nprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,\\nit is not surprising that they regard Paul\\'s negative view of\\nhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing\\nwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As\\nreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these\\napproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the\\nmouth when they see the opposing view described.  There\\'s not a lot I\\ncan do as moderator about such a situation.\\n\\nA number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of\\ndetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact\\nI\\'m not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their\\nown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the\\nquestion of whether Paul\\'s judgement should apply to modern\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nOne commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\\nof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\\nonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\\nwrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\nto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\nideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\nrelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\njudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\njudgements on these questions.\\n\\nAnother is the following: In Paul\\'s time homosexuality was associated\\nwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It\\nwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often\\noccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I\\'m\\nnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are some\\nreasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active\\nand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult\\nto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active\\nmode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His\\ncustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This\\nsupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two\\nfree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.\\nClearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,\\nslaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible\\npartners.  (However Fee\\'s commentary on I Cor cites some examples from\\nancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve\\nfree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations\\nin this paragraph shouldn\\'t be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have\\nbeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there\\nsurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not\\ninvolve slaves or children.)\\n\\nSome people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against\\nhomosexuality.  I\\'d like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by\\npromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a\\nhomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is\\nnot at risk for AIDS.\\n\\nNote that there is good reason from Paul\\'s general approach to doubt\\nthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,\\napart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his\\nuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual\\nmarriage as what God ordained.\\n\\nHowever the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning\\nagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.\\n\\nI claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\nnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul\\'s\\ntendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\\nholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\\nto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\\navoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\\nFor example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\\nmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\\nwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously\\nwould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\\nremain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\\nwould rather see them married than in a state where they might be\\ntempted to fornication.\\n\\nI believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the\\nviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is\\nnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still\\nconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the\\ncreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The\\nquestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful\\nor whether you believe that it\\'s a misfortune that is in a broad sense\\ndue to human sinfulness.  If you\\'re willing to consider the latter\\napproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more\\ndamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.\\nThe dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\\nfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\\npsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\\nattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\\n\\nThis is going to depend upon one\\'s assessment of the inherent nature\\nof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you\\nmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.\\nClearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency\\nto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these\\nconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are\\nintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for\\nhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are\\nactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes\\nAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual\\nrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent\\nto Christian heterosexual relationships.)\\n\\nIn the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we\\'ve\\nheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in\\nthis situation.  I\\'ve also seen summaries of various research and the\\nresults of various efforts for \"conversion\".  (Aside from the\\nPresbyterian report mentioned above, there\\'s an FAQ that summarizes\\nour readers\\' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that\\nlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a\\npar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to\\ndepend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn\\'t happen,\\nwhich is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\\nexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\\nof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different\\ncontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I\\nthink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that\\njudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay\\nsex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe\\nhomosexuality isn\\'t God\\'s original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul\\npreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\\nrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\\nsuggests wasn\\'t part of God\\'s original ideal either -- I think such\\nrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God\\'s love\\nwith each other.\\n\\nThere\\'s an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this\\ndiscussion.  The issue is that of \"cultural relativism\".  That is,\\nwhen Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an\\neternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations\\nin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist\\non taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes\\nsubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as\\nrelative?\\n\\nWhen looking at this issue, it\\'s worth noting that no one completely\\nrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of\\njudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians\\nconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as\\nclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:\\n\\n  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in\\n\\tthe OT -- it\\'s not in the NT, but I mention it here because\\n\\tuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it binding\\n\\ton Christians)\\n  - prohibition against swearing oaths\\n  - endorsement of slavery as an institution\\n  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner\\n\\nWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the\\nargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:\\n\\n  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific\\n\\tagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,\\n\\tbut not to our market economy.\\n  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the\\n\\tsame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was\\n\\tconcerned about\\n  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people\\n\\thow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as\\n\\tan institution\\n  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to\\n\\tRoman tax farming\\n\\nThe point I\\'m trying to make is that before applying Biblical\\nprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th\\nCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\\nrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\\nwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\\nargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\\nUntil fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and\\nmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,\\nslavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship\\nbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants\\nor slaves of God.)\\n\\nI am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally\\nrelative.  Rather, I\\'m trying to say that *some* things are, and\\ntherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in\\nthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the\\naction we\\'re talking about now has the same moral implications as the\\none that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue\\nthat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against\\nhomosexuality are still binding, I\\'m willing to listen.  Those who\\nclaim that the question doesn\\'t need to be looked at are kidding\\nthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey\\nall the rules listed above).\\n\\nOne thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue\\ncreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --\\nsome laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is\\nreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose\\nwords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among\\nChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to\\npeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.\\nThis is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as\\nstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments\\nas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I\\ncan\\'t help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way\\nof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a\\ndangerous situation for Christians.\\n\\nOn the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I\\nhave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.\\nOne of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically\\ndetermined.  I.e. \"God made me homosexual\", and I have no choice.  I\\nthink \"God made me homosexual\" is a fine view for people who already\\nbelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I\\ndon\\'t see it as an argument for acceptability.',\n",

              "  'It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support\\nthe doctrine of Original Sin.  This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with no\\nother purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, its\\nsupporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants\\nwill go to hell.\\n\\nIt\\'s very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of\\nscripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have the\\nheart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically\\nbased, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Let\\'s now take a\\nmore complete look at scripture.\\n\\nColossians 2:11-12 \"In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of\\nthe sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been\\nburied with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the\\npower of God, who raised him from the dead.\"\\n\\nIn baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a\\npersonal faith in the power of God.  Our parent\\'s faith cannot do this.  Do\\ninfants have faith?  Let\\'s look at what the Bible has to say about it.\\n\\nRomans 10:16-17 \"But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For\\nIsaiah says, \\'Lord, who has believed our message?\\'  Consequently, faith\\ncomes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word\\nof Christ.\"\\n\\nSo then we receive God\\'s gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the\\ngospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God\\'s word preached.  Kids\\nare not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\\nrespond to God\\'s word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\\nbe raised in baptism to a new life.\\n\\nEzekiel 18:20 \"The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the\\nguilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The\\nrighteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the\\nwickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.\"\\n\\nIf you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn\\'t hold us guilty\\nfor anyone else\\'s sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.\\n\\nEzekiel 18:31-32 \"Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,\\nand get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?\\nFor I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.\\nRepent and live!\"\\n\\nThe way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids\\ncannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we\\nwill then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.\\n\\nNow then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is\\nnot Biblical, let\\'s look at some of the scriptures used to support it.\\n\\nRomans 5:12 \"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and\\ndeath through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all\\nsinned--\"\\n\\nSin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to\\neach man because each man sinned.  Note that it\\'s good to read through all\\nof Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than\\nothers, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all\\nsaying basically the same thing.  Let\\'s look at one such.\\n\\nRomans 5:19 \"For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many\\nwere made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many\\nwill be made righteous.\"\\n\\nThrough the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  In\\nthe same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous.\\nWe must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each\\nman only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam.\\nOtherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to read\\nthrough this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of\\nview to see if it doesn\\'t all fit together.\\n\\nPsalm 51:5 \"Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother\\nconceived me.\"\\n\\nThis whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves\\nbefore God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God\\'s\\nown heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and\\nmurdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can\\'t\\nremember a time when he wasn\\'t sinful.  He is humbling himself before God\\nby confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is\\na hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn\\'t limited to a literal\\ninterpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).\\nFor another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.\\n\\nNow then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that\\noriginal sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is\\nnecessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with\\nother children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.\\n\\nCertainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling\\nis always that they don\\'t know any better.  Let\\'s look to see if the Bible\\nagrees with my gut feelings.\\n\\nIsaiah 7:14-15 \"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The\\nvirgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him\\nImmanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the\\nwrong and choose the right.\"\\n\\nNow just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy\\nabout Jesus.  If they don\\'t, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new\\nleader.  Jesus certainly couldn\\'t have had less knowledge than normal human\\nbabies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent\\nbefore he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see that\\nhe did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication is\\nthat Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over\\nwrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather\\nconclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don\\'t know to choose\\nthe right instead of the wrong.\\n\\nJesus himself was baptized, albeit with John\\'s baptism, not as an infant,\\nbut as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as\\nsoon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he was\\ntempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13).\\n\\nThank you for your attention.\\n\\nModerator - this should finish up the subject for a while.

This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through\\nhistory.  The Greek, for example, could say, \"better a beggar in the land\\nof the living than a king in the land of the dead.\" (Iliad, I think).\\n\\nThe question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\\nan ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam\\nor Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their\\nsins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile\\nhumanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to\\nhim.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom\\nSatan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.\\n\\n\\nIt is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The\\nrelationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely\\nextended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine\\nan eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the\\nspiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.\\n\\nIt was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous\\nwere lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness\\nthat fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with\\nthe sense world.\\n\\nIt would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient\\npeople\\'s ideas of life after death.\\n\\n\\nMankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \"the turning point of\\ntime\" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and\\nwe are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new\\nrevelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new\\nvision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains\\nsomething new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and\\nmuch more as well.\\n\\n(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf\\nSteiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my\\nviews on this subject).\\n\\n\\nThe way you refer to it as \"doctrine\" puts a modern intellectual coloring\\non it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually\\nconcrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or\\nteachings today can be received.\\n\\nI am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to\\nsimple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed\\non, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception\\nand experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of\\nexpression of the different people\\'s ideas of the time immediately\\nafter death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In\\nany case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,\\nbut by contemplating the principles themselves.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity\\nthat originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the\\nhuman being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is\\ncreated at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas\\ndominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does\\ntoday. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same\\ntime lived during that darkened time when the perception of our\\neternal spiritual being had grown dim.\\n\\n\\nIndeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal\\nirrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in\\nwhich we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a\\nsingle earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the\\nreality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in\\nterms that did not try to spell it out.\\n',\n",

              "  'Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:\\n\\n1) \"I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and\\nbetween your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush\\nyour head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.\"\\n    -Genesis 3.15\\n\\n2) \"He who commits sin is of the devil ...\"\\n    -1 John 3.8\\n\\n3) \"Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ...\"\\n    -Luke 1.28\\n\\n   From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.\\n   First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the\\nfirst promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of\\nSatan. \"[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in\\nthe truth because there is no truth in him.\" John 8.44.  Now the\\nproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and \"the\\nwoman\", and enmity between Satan and \"her seed.\"  Now the woman is both\\nEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. \\n\"Her seed\" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the\\nsame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as\\nwe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that\\nMary is also sinless because if she wasn\\'t she would 1) not be at enmity\\nwith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her\\nsinlessness to Christ\\'s sinlessness would be called into question, as\\nwould God\\'s veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the\\nserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.\\n    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the\\nArchangle Gabriel \"full of grace.\"  As I pointed out above this is from\\nthe Greek word \"Kecharitomene\" which means not just full of grace, but a\\nplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by\\nthe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, \"Hail you who have been and reamin\\nfilled with grace.\"  But that is a little to long to say, so it is\\nreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, \"you who have been\" Mary had\\nalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which\\nwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.\\n    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done\\nwhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if\\nGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his\\nMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the\\nFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo\\n, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of\\nChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on\\nthe matter in \"Ineffibilus Deus.\"',\n",

(I can supply the reference if anyone\\'s interested.)\\n\\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.

It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\\n\\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\\n\\n\\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\\n\\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark\\'s edition\\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\\n\\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\\n\\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.',\n",

              "  'Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\\n     when questioning? \\n\\nI\\'ve often found it to be the case that the theist\\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I\\'ve\\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\\n     search for their god.\\n     \\nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\\n     was behind the universe\\'s existence.  I\\'ve\\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\\n     versa, I\\'ve known Christians who were once\\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I\\'ve even known\\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.  Once the child is able\\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \\n     superstitions he\\'s been taught are nearly\\n     impossible to remove.\\n     \\nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\\n     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption\\n     of God\\'s existence and question it impartially?\\n     \\nStephen\\n\\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\\n\\n-- ',\n",
              "  '\\n\\nFirst of all, \"ceremonial law\" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes\\nused as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions,\\nwithout going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be \\na ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.\\n\\nagainst us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what\\nwhat food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days,\\nor the keeping of the sabbath.\\n\\nThe word for sabbath in this verse is \"sabbaton\" and is used throughout the\\nNew Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from\\nwhich we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the\\nsabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.\\n\\nIf one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \"the sabbath cannot\\nbe a ceremonial law\" then he will have to find some way around it, like\\nsaying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the\\n7tH day, Because \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\"  But\\nPaul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal \\nstatement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin\\nin his writings.\\n\\nAlso, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which\\ntalks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have\\nbeen a big problem for first century Christians living in a society\\nthat did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were\\nslaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath\\nif it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?',\n",

              "  'The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for\\nsome time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\\nsimply IS holy.\\n\\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\\nmass has become a commercial for God\\'s grace rather than the real\\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn\\'t\\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus\\' body.\\n\\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\\npriest get up and \\'explain\\' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\\nIt doesn\\'t help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize\\' is only\\nslightly better.\\n\\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\\ndoesn\\'t work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\\n\\nIn NYC I can recommend:\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St.\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \\n\\tSt. Joseph\\'s, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \"clean\", largely gay\\n\\tOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\\n\\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\\n\\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste\\', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen',\n",

I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been\\nshown to be consistent in the past.  Overall performance, L/R splits,\\neven matching hitting/pitching styles.  All of these will give me some\\nadvantage if used properly.\\n\\nEVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by\\nlooking at past clutch performance.  And in this case, everything else\\npointed to Sabo.\\n\\n\\nThat comes down to the same thing.  When Perez left Sabo in, he\\nwas predicting the future, the next AB.  He was predicting that\\nSabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel.\\n\\nBy supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite.\\n\\n\\nWell, yes.  You are aware of its existance.  You claim to be incapable\\nof understanding it (though I suspect you are simply unwilling).  Yet\\nyou rather forcefully state the opposite.  You don\\'t seem to think the\\nwork is worth reading (yet you obviously feel the topic is important).\\nI\\'d say this is insulting.\\n\\n\\nRIGHT!  This is the beef.

If you know of some where it *is* an\\nindicator of future performance, please let us in on your secret.\\n\\n\\nMost certainly.  As I have repeatedly stated, if you can come up with\\na study which even *hints* at a consistent clutch ability, I would\\nlove it!  However the straightforward attempts at such a study have\\nall failed miserably.\\n\\n\\nWell, it was a stupid argument.

But the second is a much stronger statement.  In fact, it\\nsuggests a rule.  We can then test this rule on past data to see if it\\nworked for recent years.  I think you will agree that if the rule\\ndidn\\'t work last year or the year before, that it is unlikely to do\\nany better this year.  Right?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not going to get into case analysis.  Sure, you can find somebody\\nwho hit poorly from \\'89-\\'91 and then hit poorly in \\'92 as well.

              "  \"A few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on\\nearth:\\n\\nOne piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\\nthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\\nburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\\n\\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\\n\\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\\n\\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\\ncross, would want to share in his death.\",\n",

If you study the \\nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \\nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \\nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \\nis what James means when he says that \"faith without works is dead\" \\nand, \"I will show you my faith by my works.\"  Remember James was \\nwriting to \"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\"  This \\nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \\nlater and wouldn\\'t understand the meaning of the original Greek.\\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\\nthe Greek.\\n\\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul\\'s\\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\\nburden of Paul\\'s life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\\nconvert a bunch of people, then the \"Judizers\" would come along and\\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\\n\"faithfulness\" today has a meaning closer to what the original\\nwriters intended.\\n\\n\\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \"keep kosher\" to a\\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\\n\\n\\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \\nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \\nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\\n\\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that \"pistis\" has\\nsome of the force of \"faithful\".  However if you take that too far,\\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that\\'s not what you meant.\\n\\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I\\'d\\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\\nJesus calls being born again.',\n",

Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\\n          based on PHIGS.\\n\\n          Next year\\'s conference is planned for March, 1994.\\n\\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\\n\\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\\n          mainframes.\\n\\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\\n          and translucency.\\n\\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add\\n          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like\\n          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.\\n          Radiosity support is also planned.\\n\\n          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging\\n          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate\\n          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase\\n          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.\\n\\n          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful\\n          \"2-call\"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-\\n          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.\\n\\n          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on\\n          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-\\n          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company\\'s  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-\\n          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS\\n          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS\\n          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data\\n          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS\\n          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described\\n          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions\\n          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G\\'s data visual-\\n          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available\\n          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or\\n          Starbase.\\n\\n          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows\\n          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most\\n          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many\\n          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-\\n          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS\\n          or ARENA is available on request.\\n\\n          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-\\n          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most\\n          workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-\\n          porates PEX support.\\n\\n          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital\\n          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the\\n          DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs\\' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.\\n          DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with\\n          support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most\\n          GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as\\n          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and\\n          the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.\\n\\n          AXP, DEC, and DEC PHIGS are trademarks of Digital Equipment  Cor-\\n          poration.

              "  'In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks, \\nI came across something that was completely new to me, \\nand I thought I\\'d offer it for comment.\\n\\nTo keep this as brief as possible, let me state my \\nobservation as a declarative statement, and then whoever \\nwants to can comment on it.  Basically, what I think \\nI\\'ve observed is that the phrase \"the Ten Commandments\", \\nas used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but \\nrather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. \\n20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase \"the Ten \\nCommandments\" should more accurately be translated \"the \\nTen Discourses\", of which the passage we call the \"Ten \\nCommandments\" is really only the first.\\n\\nI\\'m not completely convinced that the above is true, but \\nfor purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I \\nwas sure.\\n\\nArguments supporting the above idea:\\n\\n1)  There aren\\'t really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  \\nIn order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of \\nthem out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not \\nsupport such a division because they are all about not \\nworshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to \\nhave no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship \\nthe idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can\\'t violate \\nverses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that \\nthe whole passage is one command, and leaving us with \\nonly Nine \"Commandments\".  I could go on at length about \\nthis, but for now I\\'ll just stop with this summary.\\n\\n2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning\\nof the traditional \"Ten Commandments\") and Ex 31:18 \\n(where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the \\nTen Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break \\nthese ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; \\n25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; \\n31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these \\npassages begins with some variation of the phrase, \"And \\nthe LORD spoke to Moses, saying...\"  The exception is \\nEx. 21:1, which begins \"Now these are the ordinances \\nwhich you are to set before them...\"\\n\\n3)  The word translated \"commandments\" in the phrase \\n\"the Ten Commandments\" isn\\'t really the word for \\n\"commandment\", its the word for a speech, or an \\nutterance.  It\\'s a word often used for longer discourses \\nrather than individual statements; for instance, when \\ncombined with the word \\'yom\\' (day), this word is \\ntranslated \"Chronicles\" in such phrases as \"now the rest \\nof the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the \\nChronicles of x?...\"  The word for \"commandment\" is \\nfreely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps \\nit is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X\\'s, \\nhe appears to have avoided the word for commandment and \\nchosen instead a word associated with discourses longer \\nthan just a single command.\\n\\n4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the \\nstone tablets \"with the law and the commandments\" (Ex \\n24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He \\nhas finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the \\nTen Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not \\nimmediately clear why God would wait several days and \\nnine more discourses before giving these tablets to \\nMoses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses \\nwritten on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that \\nGod would not give Moses the tablets until He had \\nfinished delivering all Ten Discourses.\\n\\n5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both \\ntablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If \\nthese Ten \"Commandments\" were only the first 17 verses \\nof Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE \\nletters!  Not that He couldn\\'t have, of course, but it \\ndoes seem more likely to me that this is a reference to \\ntwo tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-\\nsized letters.\\n\\n6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out \\nthe \"commandments written on stone\" as being the \\n\"ministry of death\", \"that which is fading away,\" and \\n\"the ministry of condemnation.\"  With the possible \\nexception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is \\ndifficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17 as being temporary, \"fading away\"-type \\ncommandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone \\ntablets should happen to have included all of the \\ncommandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.\\n\\nArguments against this idea:\\n\\nThe main argument against this idea, aside from the fact \\nthat it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that \\nin Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17, \"These words the LORD spoke...and He added \\nno more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and \\ngave them to me.\"  This appears to identify the words \\njust quoted as being the only contents of the two stone \\ntablets.\\n\\nThat was my first impression, anyway.  However, after \\nsome thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how \\nyou understand the phrase \"These words.\"  If Moses meant \\n\"These words *which I have just related to you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc., then that would mean that only the \\ntraditional \"Ten Commandments\" were on the stone \\ntablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical \\ncomment--\"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc.--then that\\'s quite different.\\n\\nI did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of \\nbeing given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the \\npeople asking Moses to represent them before God, \\nwhereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of \\nMoses between the first and second discourses, several \\ndays BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This \\nreinforces the idea that Moses\\' remarks in Dt 5:22ff \\nwere intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a \\nstrictly chronological account of when God wrote what, \\nand at what point He stopped adding to what was on the \\ntablets.\\n\\nSummary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more \\nlikely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only \\nthe first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses \\nof God.  I don\\'t know if anybody has ever espoused this \\nidea before; it\\'s brand-new to me.  So, while I lean \\ntowards accepting it, I would be very interested in \\nhearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to \\noffer.',\n",

This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.

If choose to let us\\ndo as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh. \\nYou have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to\\nyou that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.  \\n\\n\\nThis may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct\\nknowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.\\n Jesus most certainly felt the \"pinpricks\" of life.  As the Scripture say:\\n\\nHeb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our\\nweaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without\\nsin.\\n\\nThe kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes\\nwhen He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine\\nto think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \"The Consciousness of\\nChrist.\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this\\ninteresting study, including clh.  \\n\\nIt is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually\\nsuffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we\\ndo.  He \"grew in knowledge.\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose\\nto be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \"led of the Spirit\" to such\\nan extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and\\nJesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him,\\nthe tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. \\nThat is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was\\nliving sequential history as you or I.  \\n\\nMaybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion\\nand one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than\\nnot.\\n\\n\\nI was once a member of that club.  THe \"free thinker\" is a glorious ideal.  By\\ncontrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository\\nof everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find\\nsuch a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist\\nwishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. \\nBut what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \"rational\\ndoubt\" when in fact he was led to it by his \"faith\".  He must acknowledge that\\nwhile it is rational doubt for him as a \"free thinker\" to criticize the\\nChristian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize\\nhim as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no\\nfaith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.\\n\\nPascal pointed out that \"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.\\n Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\"  The fact that skeptics are not\\nskeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must\\nbelieve in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or\\neven most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a\\nmeasure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define\\nhimself only in negative terms, hence the term \"a\"-theist.\\n\\nSome people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In\\nmy campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. \\nHowever, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word,\\nevery point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication\\nspeaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make\\nsense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.\\n\\nThat is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism\\nis arbitrary.  Next time you\\'re in a room of skeptics, yell out \"Look, your fly\\nis undone!\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he\\nbelieves without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it\\nunderlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he\\nknows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. \\nThe answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on\\npresuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before\\nit is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and\\ncritical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective\\nand neutral.  In other words, another myth.  \\n\\nPresuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is\\nsomething we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can\\nbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are\\nour silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for\\nabsence.\\n\\n\\nOf course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had\\nbeen in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \"Highlander\" movie. \\nBut again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of\\nGod.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic\\ntheology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His\\nprophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you\\nare to reject God\\'s annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct\\nunderstanding of Himself.',\n",

Yet the fact remains, there is a\\nplace called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to\\nexperience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we\\ncan to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going\\nto \"outer darkness.\".  \\n\\nJesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn\\'t prepare hell for people.  He prepared\\nit for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,\\nthat God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the\\nelect are the \"whosoever will\" and the nonelect are the \"whosoever wont\\'s.\" \\nWhether or not that\\'s theologically sound, I couldn\\'t defend, but its\\npractical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \"Ye would not.\"  \\n\\nNow, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be\\nChristians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \"I don\\'t believe in hell.  I\\nbelieve in the religion of Jesus.\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more\\nabout hell than He did about heaven!  \"Oh I believe in the religion of the\\nsermon on the mount.\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the\\nmount.  You\\'ll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. \\nSeveral times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over\\nin the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. \\nNot Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. \\nThe great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn\\'t\\nwant to see them go there.\\n\\nNow, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,\\nnot some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \"where the worm never dies, and\\nwhere the fire never goes out.\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell\\na \"furnace of fire.\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \"condemnation.\"  \"And\\nthis is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because\\ntheir deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  \\n\\nHow can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?\\n Not only that, but He went through hell.  That\\'s what Calgary was all about. \\nWhen my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \"outer\\ndarkness.\"  \\n\\nDo you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over\\nhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are\\nprostituting their bodies over there?  That\\'s not what hell is.  Hell\\'s not a\\nparty.  There\\'s no fellowship there.  He called it \"outer darkness.\"  \"Outer\"\\n-away from God.  \"Darkness\" -God is light.  \\n\\nNo when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated\\nJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That\\'s is a sobering thought.  As my\\nson would say, an \"awesome\" thought.  \\n\\n\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  Hell is isolation.  There\\'s no\\nfellowship in hell.  There\\'s no friendship in hell.  There\\'s no loving embrace\\nin hell.  There\\'s no hand shake in hell.  There\\'s no word of encouragement in\\nhell.  \\n\\n\"I thirst.\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving\\nwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it\\neternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman\\'s body, will\\ncrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way\\nand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of\\nenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  \\n\\nIn a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life\\nministries.  I\\'ve remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the\\nillustration that I gave wasn\\'t his.  His illustration was that he was talking\\nto his barber and his barber\\'s wife and daughter had just recently been saved\\nand he was commenting about it to Jack.  \"They sing these songs and read Bible\\nverses, and their praising this and that -I can\\'t stand it!  Jack, do you think\\nGod would send me to hell?\"  Jack answered by saying, \"Yes I think he would!\" \\nOf course the barber said, \"What do you mean by that.\"  \"Well if you can\\'t\\nstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to\\nGod now, what would you do in heaven where they\\'ll do it for eternity?  You\\'d\\nbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He\\'d put you where it would match what\\nyou really are.\"   It makes a man think.\\n\\nThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal\\nexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don\\'t ask\\nme how, I don\\'t know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He\\ndied, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He\\npurchased eternal life for the \"whosoever wills.\"  He suffered eternal\\njudgment.  \\n\\nA lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \"Everybody is going\\nto be saved eventually.\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He\\'ll separate\\nthem.  The sheep from the goats.  \".After you die there\\'s a probationary period\\nin which God prepares you for heaven.\"  No, my Bible says that \"It is appointed\\nunto men once to die and then comes judgment.\"  Some of the cultist believe in\\nannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you\\'re squished\\nout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as\\nthere is in heaven.  \\n\\nI don\\'t enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don\\'t enjoy\\nlistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a\\nplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any\\nhope that people aren\\'t going there, I\\'d give it to you, but I haven\\'t found\\nit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a\\nGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of\\ncreatures we are and therefore we\\'re responsible, the fact that He has placed\\nus in a \"uni\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is\\nsuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us\\nfrom hell leads us to two applications.\\n\\n1)  As I\\'ve already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. \\nIts not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just\\naround the bend the bridge is out.  \"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we\\npersuade men.\"\\n\\n2)  If you haven\\'t accepted Jesus are your Savior, you\\'re taking an awful\\nchance.

              "  'I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,\\n   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.\\n   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,\\n   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,\\n   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.\\n\\n   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. \\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)\\n\\nNAME\\n   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations\\n\\nDESCRIPTION\\n  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on\\n  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both\\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\\n\\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\\n\\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\\n\\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\\n\\nFEATURES\\n\\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \\n  the processed image will be displayed.\\n\\n  Current features include\\n\\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\\n\\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\\n\\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\\\\alpha$\\\\small$\\\\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\\n\\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\\n\\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\\n\\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\\n    circle).\\n\\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\\n\\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\\n\\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\\n    arbitrary order.\\n\\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\\n\\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\\n\\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\\n\\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\\n\\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\\n\\n  o Performs image type conversions.\\n\\n  o Converts image formats.\\n\\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\\n\\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\\n    back and display it.\\n\\n  o Modify an individual pixel\\'s RGB values.\\n\\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\\n    resulting power spectra.\\n\\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\\n\\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\\n      o  CompuServ GIF\\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\\n      o  TIFF\\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\\n\\nHardware requirements:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\\n\\nWhere to get it:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z\\n   where xxx is the version number.

              "  'According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \"in X\\'s\\nname\" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today\\nwould call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus\\' culture authorized\\nto conduct business \"in John\\'s name\" had full authority over John\\'s\\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\\nwork only for John\\'s benefit and consonant with John\\'s wishes.  It was\\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\\n\"in John\\'s name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\\nand religious definitions of \"faith\".)\\n\\nWith this cultural background, praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" does not\\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\\n\"fiduciary\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\\nKingdom.  The message of \"praying in Jesus\\' name\" is thus closely\\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God\\'s\\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" is not only\\npresent but prominent in the Lord\\'s Prayer, although the verbal\\nforumula is absent.\\n\\nThe act of praying the words \"In Jesus\\' Name\" may be beneficial if\\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\\nadvancement of God\\'s Kingdom.  For that reason, I\\'m not quite ready\\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\\n\\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\\netc.) don\\'t seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that\\'s B.C.E. or\\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).

God then cannot ask for anything but  \\npunishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John  \\n3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that  \\nthrough him it might be saved.\" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do  \\nwith painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin  \\nagainst me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews  \\nthey are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and  \\ndis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the  \\nfater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.\\n  for those who don\\'t have that right, in the view of the bible they stand  \\nolone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.  \\ni can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to  \\nHell? that step is much more rewarding.\\n\\nstan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu\\nmy opinions are my own, you may borrow them',\n",

Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines?

Therefore, the Palestinian Jewish leaders\\ngot together and stated that the books written from the time of Ben Sira (Sirach)\\nonward were not sacred writings.  They justified this from Zech. 13.

At other times I\\nget a little IRATE.  \\n\\nThere are all kinds of people in every group and I take offense at\\nintolerance.  It's awfully hard to tolerate such people. =) ( OOPS!

I beleive this is\\ncorrect. \\n\\nBTW Love the sinner hate the sin is a slippery slope, with hatred at the\\nbottom. \\n\\n\\nINCREDIBLY CHOPPED UP POST\\nI won't even try to tell you where the deletions came out\\n\\n\\n\\nI find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can\\nmanufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even the\\ngreatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical\\noddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust.\\nMankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness\\nthat transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the\\nend.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little\\npurposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others)\\nsuffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at\\nleast able to put it out of their minds.\\n\\nTo me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the\\ntrue reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is\\na school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That\\ngives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure\\noff.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms\\nif you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress,\\ngrow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your\\nlove, especially when it's dificult to do so.  Honest effort is rewarded\\nby God, he knows our limitations.\\n\\n\\n\\nInteresting theological question.  I have a feeling that most common\\nperception of eternal life is WAY off base.  If I were to be imprisoned\\nin the limited ego/mind I am in now I doubt I would choose imortality. \\nIt would get awfully boring.  \\n\\nTWO SERIOUS QUESTIONS/INVITATIONS TO DISCUSSION\\n1. What is the nature of eternal life?\\n2. How can we as mortals locked into space time conceive of it?\",\n",

Since Christians\\nMichael> citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have\\nMichael> at least READ the story, it amounts to slander -- a charge\\nMichael> that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\\n\\nand\\n\\nMichael>  It is just\\nMichael> as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it\\'s a\\nMichael> secondary argument from the \\'phobic contingent) to equate\\nMichael> homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the\\nMichael> rape of God\\'s messengers.\\n\\nLet\\'s review the Sodom and Gomorrah story briefly.  It states\\nclearly that the visitors were angels.  But \"all the men from every\\npart of the city of Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the\\nhouse.  They called to Lot, `Where are the *men* who came to \\nyou tonight?  Bring them out to us so that we can have sex \\nwith them.\\' \" \\n\\nFor the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men\\nof Sodom and by Lot as *men*.  Furthermore we know from Gen 18:20,21\\nthat the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sin--before\\nthe angels visited the city.  It is clear that the grievous sin\\nof Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex.  It appears that\\nthe men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had\\ngroup orgies in the public square--which simply indicates \\nthe extremity of their depravity.  It does not show that lesser \\ndegrees of homosexuality are not sinful, as Michael would have us\\nbelieve.\\n\\nUltimately our understanding of God\\'s will for sexuality comes from\\nthe creation story--not solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.  He\\ncreated us male and female, and instituted marriage as a relationship\\nbetween one male and one female, \"Therefore a man will leave his\\nfather and mother, and be united with his wife, and they will become\\none flesh.\"  This marriage relationship is the only sexual\\nrelationship which God blesses and sanctions. He regulates and\\nprotects the marriage of man and woman, and even uses it as a picture\\nof the relationship between himself and his church.  But we find not\\none word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between \\ntwo men, or between two women.\\n\\nEverything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from\\nor expresses God\\'s will in instituting and blessing marriage.  Thus\\nthe Levitical code, which was given only to the Jews, forbade incest,\\nhomosexuality, bestiality; the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and\\nthe coveting of our neighbor\\'s wife; other commandments forbade rape.\\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and\\nperverse (Jude 7) because they abandoned and/or polluted the marriage\\nrelationship.  Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as `unnatural\\',\\nRomans 1:26,27--not because this was simply Paul\\'s opinion,\\nbut because it was contrary to God\\'s purpose in creating us\\nmale and female.\\n  \\nMichael> Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here\\nMichael> and in every corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they\\nMichael> ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously\\nMichael> have never thought about, maybe never even read), in TOTAL\\nMichael> ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest\\nMichael> charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\\nMichael> manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they\\nMichael> suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss\\nMichael> our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what\\nMichael> it is.\\n\\nReally, have you no better response to `slander\\' than more\\nslander?',\n",

Jamie Navarro pitched\\nseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\\nin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has\\npitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest\\non the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\\n\\nIt doesn't look much better for the hitters.

Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game\\nand giving up 6.6/game. \\n\\nStill, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better.

This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\\nthat the feast of _Mary\\'s Conception_ under the title \"The Conception\\nof Saint Anne\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\\nis the incorruptible timber \"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\\nof Christ\\'s sinless body\"; she is \"God\\'s Eden, in whom there is\\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\"  Her perfect\\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\\nshe was hailed as \"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\".\\n...\\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \\ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\\n...\\n\\nNow let\\'s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\\nFrom \"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\" by John A. Hardon:\\n\\nBaptism -\\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\\n\\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\\n power to think and to choose freely.\\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\\n title to enter heaven.\\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\\nfreely.\\n\\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam\\'s\\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\\nbodies on the last day...\\n\\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the \\'puzzle\\'):\\n\\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \\nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary\\'s birth but\\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel\\'s greetings was:\\n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\\nBlessed art thou amongst women\".\\n\\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\\n\\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\\n                definitely want to be with those He\\n                has made _blessed_)\\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\\n\\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\\nand blessed_ as the \\'tabernacle\\' for the coming body\\nof Christ and so,\\n\\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart.

You should read Wilkinson\\'s\\nEgyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British\\nMasonry.  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black\\nmason.  I\\'ve talked with him, though much he likes to hide (\"mystery\"). \\nSpecial handshakes and all.  When he first started trying to \"evangelize\" me,\\nhe told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a\\n\"mystery\" religion.  THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and\\nchildrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest\\ndegree mason every learns of.\\nI haven\\'t read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired\\napologist (can\\'t remember his name) on TV, didn\\'t exactly come to this same\\nconclusion.  \\n\\n\"Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally\\nrepresented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented\\nvery frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity\\n-i.e. as a child in his mother\\'s arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, \\'the\\nson, the husband of his mother,\\' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this\\ngod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none\\nother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was\\noriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,\\nor wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with\\nthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had\\nthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in\\nperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,\\nconsidering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to\\nBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the\\nMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. \\nHe was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian\\ngoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, \\'The God of\\nFortification.\\'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally\\ncelebrated as \\'the strong chief of the buildings.\\'  THis strong chief of the\\nbuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall\\ncharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the\\nson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by\\nPlutarch, that \\'Osiris was black\\'.......\"  Hislop\\n\\nIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his\\ncerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told\\nme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he\\nstarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months\\nto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately\\nrepented from \\'mysteries\\' of the lodge!)\\n\\nNimr-rod from Nimr, a \"leopard,\" and rada or rad \"To subdue.\"  It is a\\nuniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia\\nof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of\\nsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or\\nshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the \"spotted\\ncow\".\\n\\nI\\'ll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all\\nfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to\\nbe a \"cold slap to the face\" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that\\nMasonry doesn\\'t find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally\\ntalked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating\\nyourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?',\n",

Kiki Cuyler cut\\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell\\'s speed allowed him to cut the ball off\\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \\n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don\\'t have to pitch to Schmidt or\\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\\nRose at first), and it\\'s a credit to the Phillies that they\\'ve been able to\\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas\\' grounder\\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.

They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets\\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \\n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\\npitching that just wouldn\\'t tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves\\' park had been a homer\\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday\\'s\\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the \\'61 Yankees\\' pace.\\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves\\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff\\'s batting average was even rising.  Of\\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can\\'t afford\\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\\'t\\nDavis will get decked once.\"\\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\\nthe nastness of the Astros\\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It\\'s as if some three-year-old threw a\\ntantrum and told his playmates: \\'If I can\\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit\\nhome runs\\',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\\nAstros didn\\'t score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\\n     \"They\\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\\'ve got to be ready to\\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We\\'ll go with\\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers\\'\\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\\n     \"We\\'re mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\\nplays can do it now and then.  We\\'re sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\\nguess that\\'s why they\\'re so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The \\'Stros\\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\\n     Standings after these weekend series:\\nA.L.East\\nTeam                     W           L           GB\\nNew York                68        42          --\\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\\nDetroit                 64        46           4\\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\\nWashington              39         73          28\\n\\nA.L.West\\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\\nMinnesota               61         48            1\\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\\nCalifornia              57         56            8\\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\\n\\nN.L.East\\nChicago          57         53                --\\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\\nNew York         48         64               10\\n\\nN.L.West\\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\\nHouston          50          61               17.5\\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5',\n",

One of \\nthe basic problems with something like \"clutch\" batting average - overall\\nbatting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. \\nAdding to the sample size doesn\\'t seem to help much.  As a counterexample to \\nwhat you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\\n\\n               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\\n               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\\n \\nMaldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\\nLemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\\n\\nIf you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\\nsituations, you\\'d bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \\n1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\\nhit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \\ncompletely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ \"clutch\"\\nat bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple\\nmeasure of clutchness, let\\'s just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use \\n\\'84-\\'87 to predict \\'88 for those 96 players, you\\'d find that 27 of the\\n96 were below league average in that measure both in \\'84-87 and in \\'88,\\n26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were \\nabove in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,\\nyou\\'d expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The\\ndifference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment\\nis not statisically significant.\\n\\nBTW, correlating players\\' _overall_ batting average from \\'84-\\'87 with\\n\\'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\\nsomething better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their\\n(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of \\n0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\\n\\n\\nActually, it\\'s technically incorrect to say that we can\\'t predict future\\nclutch performance.  It\\'s more correct to say that we can\\'t predict\\nfuture clutch performance with any skill.\\n\\nHarold',\n",

So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\\nsort a directory listing?\\n',\n",

But if there are zero verses that \"\\'clearly\\' address the issues,\" \\ndoesn\\'t that mean that there are also no verses that clearly *support* your \\ncase?  Are you sure you want to say that there are zero verses that clearly \\naddress the issues?\\n\\n\\nThe story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity \\nto \"know\" the two men who were Lot\\'s guests; the fact that the Sodomites became \\nangry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they \\nwere interested only in homosexual intercourse.  Yes, what they wanted was \\nrape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong.  Some \\nChristians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as \\nsinful as the rape aspect of their desire.  The passage does not say what it \\nwas that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended \\nrape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible \\nalternatives in the light of related Scriptures.  I do not believe that those \\nwho believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying \\nto say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape.\\n\\nYou seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the \\nfact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to \\n\"stigmatize\" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape.  I can \\nsee how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion \\nthat there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again we\\'re not \\nsupposed to start from our conclusions because that\\'s circular reasoning.  If \\nGod is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more \\nprobably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites\\' \\nblatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape.  Later on I \\nwill document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises \\n*any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults.\\n\\n\\nThe moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church \\nas the proper  authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be \\nlegitimate, and thus the church\\'s refusal to recognize \"perverted\" marriages \\nwas circular reasoning.  My questions, however, had nothing to do with the \\nchurch ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a \\nstraw man.  In terms of my original question, the precise \\ndefinition/translation of \"porneia\" isn\\'t really important, unless you are \\ntrying to argue that the Bible doesn\\'t really condemn extramarital sex.  I\\'m \\nnot sure the moderator was trying to do that.\\n\\nIn any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.  \\nWhen Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, \"Have you not read, that He who \\ncreated them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, \\'For this \\ncause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and \\nthe two shall become one flesh\\'?  Consequently they are no longer two, but one \\nflesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.\" (Mt. \\n19:4-6).  I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife \\n(female) is a divinely-ordained union.  In other words, the institution of \\nheterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men, \\nand not by the church, but by God.  Men are not supposed to dissolve this \\nunion, in Jesus\\' words, because it is not something created by men.\\n\\nThis is not circular reasoning, this is just reading God\\'s word.  I read in the \\nBible that God ordained the union of male and female.  I do not read of any \\nsimilar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females.  Granted, there \\nhave been uninspired men who have ordained \"alternative\" unions (isn\\'t Caligula \\nreported to have \"married\" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to \\nas \"what God has joined together\" is the heterosexual union of a man and his \\nwife.\\n\\n(Pardon me for mentioning Caligula.  I know that\\'s probably inflammatory, and I \\nshould save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post.  \\nPlease hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of \\nmy reply.)\\n\\nAnyway, my original question was not whether we should translate \"porneia\" in a \\nway that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was: \\ngiven that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as \\ndivinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of \\nmarriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful?  Of course, I see now that first we \\nneed to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage.  You \\nseem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and \\nother sins) are really wrong:\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as \"porneia\" and all \\nthe rest was, in Paul\\'s day, what we would call a FAQ; i.e. the Law, as the \\n\"tutor\" appointed by God to lead us to Christ, had just spent some sixteen \\ncenturies drumming into the heads of God\\'s people the idea that things like \\nhomosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death.  \\nPerhaps Paul didn\\'t go into detail on what \"porneia\" &c were because after 1600 \\nyears he considered the question to have been dealt with already.  Perhaps the \\nreason God\\'s apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining \\na distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any \\nsignificant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law.  \\nI\\'ll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just \\nwanted to point out that the New Testament\\'s failure to develop a detailed new \\nstandard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about \\nsexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for \\npracticing homosexuality!\\n\\n\\nAnd how do you define an \"obsessively driven\" mode of sexual behavior?  How do \\nyou determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex \\ndrives?  Is the desire to have \"sinful\" sex an obsessively driven mode of \\nbehavior?  I think you see that this is circular reasoning:  Why is it defined \\nas sinful?  Because it is obsessive.  What makes it obsessive?  The fact that \\nthe person is driven to seek it even though it\\'s sinful.  Or is it obsessive \\nbecause it is a desire for that which society condemns?  Once again, that\\'s \\ncircular:  Why is it defined as obsessive?  Because the person wants it even \\nthough society condemns it.  Why does society condemn it?  Because it is \\nobsessive.\\n\\nYou seem to be trying to limit the Bible\\'s condemnation of \"porneia\" to only \\n\"perverted\" sex acts, but I don\\'t think you can really define \"perverted\" \\nwithout falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of.  What, \\nthen, is Paul condemning when he declares that \"Fornicators...shall not enter \\nthe kindgom of heaven\"?\\n\\n\\nI think you misunderstood me:  I was not trying to make an argument on some \\ntechnical definition of \"porneia\", I was raising the issues of the sinfulness \\nof extramarital sex and the lack of any Scriptural evidence of a homosexual \\ncounterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couples.\\n\\n\\nPlease remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality, in part \\n2.\\n\\n\\nI am glad you asked.  Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual \\nintercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this \\nwould show that God\\'s condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual \\nlaw?  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual \\nbehavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that \\nGod\\'s definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to \\njust the ritual law and those who are under the Law?\\n\\nI\\'ve been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the \\nsubject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping \\nrequirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to \\nrest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on \\nthe Sabbath.  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements \\nsuch as \"Thou shalt not kill\", and requirements that are merely part of the \\n(temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath.\\n\\nThe point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of \\nhomosexual intercourse as \"an abomination\" is *just* a part of the temporary, \\nJews-only Law of Moses.  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by \\nGod as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those \\nguilty of this behavior by death or exile.  Here\\'s why:\\n\\nBack in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in \\nthe possession of \"the Amorite\"--kinda hard on the Amorite, don\\'t you think?  \\nBut in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds:  \\nit seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because \"the \\niniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete\".\\n\\nRemember, this is all long before there was a ritual law.  What then was the \\niniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his \\nbeing cast out of his own land and/or killed?  Go back and look at Lev. 18 \\nagain.  Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest, \\nhomosexuality, and bestiality.  Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, \"Do \\nnot defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the \\nnations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_.  For the \\nland has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so \\nthe land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these \\nabominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their \\npeople.\"\\n\\nNotice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of \\nMoses) are about to be punished because they have \"defiled\" themselves and \\ntheir land by committing \"abominations\" that include incest, bestiality, and \\nhomosexuality.  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these \\nsame \"abominations\" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on \\nanyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man \"lying \\nwith another man as one lies with a woman\" (Lv. 20:13).  Their \\n\"bloodguiltiness\" was upon them, meaning that in God\\'s eyes, they deserved to \\ndie for having done such things.  According to Lev. 18:26-29, even \"the alien \\n[non-Jew] who sojourns among you\" was to refrain from these practices, on \\npenalty of being \"cut off [by God?] from among their people.\"\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the \\nclaim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not \\nthe homosexuality, in Sodom.  Since God took the trouble to specifically list \\nsex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the \\nCanaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay \\nsex), I\\'d say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even \\nby those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant.\\n\\n\\nAccording to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable \\nfor teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I \\nbelieve that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can \\nlearn from studying it.  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is \\na violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law \\n(for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping).  Where God reveals that certain \\nactions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I \\nconclude that God\\'s objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a \\nperson is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself.  In the case \\nof homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling \\nabomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the \\nLaw as well as for those who are.  Thus, I am not at all trying to say that \\nGentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply \\nsaying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not \\nobligated to keep the Law.  If this is so, then I do not think we can appeal to \\nour exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has \\ndeclared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile.\\n\\n(continued in Part 2)',\n",

Many Protestants\\nhave a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  \"The soul\\nalone with God\" is certainly important for Protestants, but it\\'s by no\\nmeans the whole story.\\n\\nI have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out,\\nProtestants don\\'t have quite the same problem you do, because we\\nbelieve that the church had a Fall at some point.

The consequences of having it\\nearlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.

Therefore, your question to me is \"what is\\nthe objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?\"  When phrased\\nthat way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately\\napparent what my objection to \"celebrating\" her would be.\\n \\n > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.\\n \\n      No, you are thinking perhaps of \"Ressurection Sunday\" I think. \\n(Though I\\'m not too crazy about the word \"Sunday\", but I certainly like\\nthis phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)\\n     For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of\\nFirst Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following\\nthe Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern\\nparlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection\\non the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all\\nover the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday\\nfollowing Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical\\nmethods?\\n \\n > I don\\'t recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate\\n > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that\\n > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?\\n \\n      So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore\\ngoddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that\\nwhore out of the discussion.\\n \\n > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if\\n > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of\\n > words we are going to have to drop.

Are there different \"rules\" that\\napply to them as well?  Or if there is no more \"male and female\" can Adam\\nand Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are\\ndifferences in form and function.

Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the\\ncelebration of Christ\\'s resurrection.  Postings trying to convince\\nthem that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run\\nthe risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.\\nThey are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people\\'s minds\\nbetween their celebration and the pagan goddess.

Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  families\\nconfess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten\\nof the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and\\nwas born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect\\nman with soul, body and mind  ($  \\\\nu o  \\\\upsilon \\\\zeta $); He  was crucified,\\ndied, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the\\nHeavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all\\ncreation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the\\nChurch as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His\\nglory, according to the Scriptures.\\n\\n2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of\\nTheodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that\\nChrist is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and\\nby nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature\\nGod,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.\\n\\n3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by\\nuniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which\\nHe has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature,\\nwhich He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will\\nand energy.\\n\\n4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills\\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nare united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nwithout  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthought alone.\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n5.

It is the fundamental premis \"A is not not-A\". If a thing\\nis true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic \\nasumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We\\nshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \"believe\",\\nhowever. The weak sense means I am not sure. \"I believe Tom went to \\nthe library.\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense\\nmeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \"I believe \\nthat nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\" (despite \\nthe fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian\\nbelief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs\\nof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological \\ntopics.)\\n \\n\\nNote that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the \\nmajority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that\\nif Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be\\nfalse, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. \\n(And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)\\n \\n\\nIt is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless \\nthey have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks\\nand wants.\\n\\n\\nMost Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living\\ntradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly\\nby the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.\\n\\n\\nIf depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet\\ntall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we \\nmay both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive\\nthat he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.\\n \\n\\nThus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being \\ncan find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find \\nabsolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who\\ndoes not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.\\n\\n\\nHere I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the\\nknowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass \\nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole\\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\\n \\nIt is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \\nsame belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail\\nto understand each other\\'s words as expressions of the same belief\\nand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great\\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\\nagreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs\\nare equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict\\nsome other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations\\nof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have\\nbeen stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,\\n**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical\\nto say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct, \\nbut if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long\\nas we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other \\nas in error.',\n",

The question I want to turn to is what that would\\nmean for Paul\\'s readers and for later Christians.

My own biases (loosely\\ncharacterizable as \"liberal\") will be evident, but I am not grinding an\\naxe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD\\nto reach \"closure\" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we\\neach, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.\\n\\nSo; stipulating Paul\\'s intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS\\nREADERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is\\na second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?\\n\\nSince Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st\\nCorinthians, there are two \"positive\" answers and one \"negative\" to this\\nquestion:\\n\\n+\\ta.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has\\n\\t    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem-\\n\\t    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be\\n\\t    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no\\n\\t    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence\\n\\t    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]\\n\\n+\\tb.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul,\\n\\t    what God means \"behind\" Paul\\'s inspired word-choice.)\\n\\n-\\tc.  We *don\\'t* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre-\\n\\t    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul,\\n\\t    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ (\"those who have\\n\\t    more\" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is \"obvious\" from\\n\\t    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB\\n\\t    translates it as \"grabbers\") or even _methusoi_ (\"drunkards\"\\n\\t    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult,\\n\\t    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)\\n\\nThe three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration\\nfor the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards\\ntradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical\\ndemand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n_ad_ a:\\tIt is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the\\n\\tcommunity of Christ\\'s disciples and their successors, and that\\n\\tour NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition.\\n\\tBut it\\'s also the case that we know little or nothing about this\\n\\ttradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that\\n\\twe have access to the tradition only after several generations of\\n\\tpossibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only\\n\\tdocumentation of the tradition in the critical era.\\n\\n_ad_ b:\\tIf we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an\\n\\tattempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under-\\n\\tstanding the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of\\n\\tmen nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit\\n\\tfrom blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But\\n\\tthe downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit\\n\\tas our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that\\n\\ttakes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent\\n\\tunderstanding supposedly derived from the \"clear\" Word of God.\\n\\n\\t\\t[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought\\n\\t\\tconstrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even\\n\\t\\twhile reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture;\\n\\t\\tthe more bizarre forms of \"I will read Scripture my way\"\\n\\t\\tare primarily a fringe aspect of \"cultic\" Protestantism.]\\n\\n\\tThe main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no\\n\\tmeans for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel\\n\\t*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible\\n\\tconflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind\\n\\t\"convinced\" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously\\n\\turge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian\\n\\tagainst Christian.  To what purpose?\\n\\n_ad_ c:\\tThe critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can\\n\\treach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open\\n\\tto all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually\\n\\tpossible. :-)\\n\\n\\t[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias;\\n\\tone complaint against critical methodology is that it \"dissolves\"\\n\\tfaith -- but surely a \"faith\" that cannot honestly face the evalu-\\n\\tation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to\\n\\taddress.]\\n\\nAnyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between\\n\"liberal\" and \"conservative\" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme\\nzealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition\\ntends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that\\ndespite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as\\nultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.

What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi-\\nbility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it\\'s precisely\\nwhere inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they\\'re most dangerous.\\n\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of\\ntradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them).\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the\\ntraditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus\\nand Peter and Paul do not so much \"throw out\" tradition as subject it to\\nradical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:\\n\\n     \"the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 23:23)\\nand  \"On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,\\n      and the Prophets, also.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 22:40)\\n\\nIf there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the\\nchallenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation\\nto go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts\\n(vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus\\' reported\\nwords and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination\\nto *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges\\nagainst are in fact open to challenge.\\n\\nAll traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may\\nlead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual\\ninstruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and\\ninherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is\\nimmune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy\\nand good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from\\nlove of God and love of neighbor.\\n\\nI am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  That\\nthe Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am\\ntoo dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I\\n*know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians\\nappealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated\\n\"sodomites\" as the \"cause\" of the earthquake, so that legislation was\\npassed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in\\naccord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human\\ntradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that much\\ndifferent in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick\\nto condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit,\\nthen I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord\\nis that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians,\\nfor the truth that lives in the Body of Christ.\\n\\nAnd I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel\\nsaid to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church:\\n\\n\\t\"be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise,\\n\\tthis movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of\\n\\tits own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not\\n\\tonly be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves\\n\\tfighting against God.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Acts 5:36...39] \\n\\nAll I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures\\nwith a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our\\nfirst Christian witnesses\\' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER\\nreadings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and\\nrabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the\\nlove of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history of\\nChristians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to\\njudge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness of\\nthe Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who\\nare NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God\\'s truth.\\n-- \\nMichael L. Siemon\\t\\tI say \"You are gods, sons of the\\nmls@panix.com\\t\\t\\tMost High, all of you; nevertheless\\n    - or -\\t\\t\\tyou shall die like men, and fall\\nmls@ulysses.att..com\\t\\tlike any prince.\"   Psalm 82:6-7\\n\\n[There\\'s a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as to\\nwhether you\\'re speaking of tradition in Paul\\'s time or ours.  I think\\nthere are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and\\nhis readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words\\nin the context of that shared tradition.  That\\'s what makes me think\\nthat these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that\\nPaul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex.\\nEverything else he says on sex is consistent with that background.\\nThe tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with\\nthat background.  Even if the words in the sin lists aren\\'t the most\\ngeneral terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there\\'s\\nsome evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of\\nevidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no\\nevidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nBut when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that\\'s rather a\\nhorse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a\\ncontinuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition\\nmight be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul\\'s original\\nmeaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted\\nhim, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in\\nour time because of the universal judgement of the church between his\\ntime and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition.\\nA radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent.\\ntradition to illuminate Paul\\'s original meaning, but not use the\\nCatholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to\\nhomosexuality should be.',\n",

In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th\\ncommandments and in the midst of this listing is \"homosexuals.\"  The decalogue,\\nabove everything else, is seen as God\\'s absolute.  If you don\\'t believe in\\nabsolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul\\nreveals to be the Messiah of the NT. \"Lord Christ Jesus\" transliterates to read\\n\"Jehovah\\'s Anointed Savior.\"  \\n  In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan\\ngentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards)\\nis not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knew\\nfull well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for\\napplication in the NT.  As I\\'ve said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away\\nwith.\\n\\n\\nThis understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being\\nposted.  Please refer to it.\\n\\n\\nWe can do better than \"probably\" which is not an adequate defense against the\\nstatement that Paul\\'s culture didn\\'t have the same understanding of\\nhomosexuality as ours.  \\nAgain read the article because it uses facts.\\n\\n\\nI think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of\\nworking with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical application\\nof the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue of\\nhomosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who\\nis contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend,\\nyet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there is\\nno remorse, then I feel that Paul\\'s \"pastoral\" care, as presented in the\\nCorinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellion\\nshould be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer,\\nthen one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a member\\nin your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn\\'t\\nhesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betrays\\nthe present \"political correctness\" of the issue.

THis is how\\nthe morals decay.  \\n\\nI guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of\\neconomics.

Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\\n\\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell\\'s \"learned discussion\"\\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the \\'mistress\\' or who hires him on\\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\\naffirms (109).\\n     This is Scrogg\\'s interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \\nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\\n\\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\\nthe lists\" (104). \\n\\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\\nin today\\'s Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\\nrelevant to today\\'s debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\\n\\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\\n\\nD. Wright\\n\\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell\\'s\\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell\\'s treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \\nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell\\'s\\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\\n\\n     Wright also faults Boswell\\'s claims regarding linguistic features of the\\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\\ngender\" (132). \\n\\n     It is with Boswell\\'s treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \\nFor example, Aristides\\' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell\\'s discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \\n\\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\\n\\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\\n\\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\\n\\n     Wright next replies to Boswell\\'s contention that the term would not be\\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul\\'s letters or deliberately avoid citing\\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \\n\\n     Boswell\\'s treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright\\'s attention\\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom\\'s infrequent use of the term.  Wright\\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \\n\\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell\\'s limited\\nconclusion based on them.\\n\\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\\n\\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  ',\n",

Henderson, 4.4; and Thomas, 4.4\\n\\nIn short, Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons\\never in the game's history -- better than any year had by Mantle,\\nMays, Williams, etc. (If you disagree, don't flame me; flame the\\nwriters of Total Baseball.) Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and\\nneck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one\\nhad the better year can be considered a toss-up. Thus, Total Baseball\\nsupports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of 1992.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\n--------------------------\\nPhil Brown                |\\naka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |\",\n",

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object.

Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,\\n   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to\\n   any specified angle.\\no  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan\\n   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to\\n   region target mean, median, or modal value.\\no  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,\\n   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.\\no  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of\\n   region of an image.\\no  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot\\n   keyword values for a set of images.\\no  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,\\n   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower\\n   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive\\n   background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical\\n   aperture shape to image isophotes. \\no  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot\\n   of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`\\n   centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,\\n   change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and\\n   adjust cursor size on image.

Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for\\nthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the\\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  \"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\"\\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\\nrequires work on our part.\\n\\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn\\'t care what we believe.  What\\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\\noneself about believing in the first place.  \\n\\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\\ndoing God\\'s work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\\nJesus\\' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\\ncareful instruction.\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\\nTimothy 4:16:  \"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\"\\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus\\' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\\nhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be\\na disciple completely in both thought and deed.  ',\n",

              "  'First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers\\nto my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smith\\'s posting, I will\\naddress some issues that have caused misunderstanding:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic\\non the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not\\nescape your notice. \\n\\nThe correct word is \\'likely\\'. There is no way to be sure our models and\\ntheories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence,\\nbut not proved - no theory can be \\'true\\' in a mathematical sense.\\n\\nHowever, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of\\nphenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can\\n_predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories\\nscience has come up with have passed this test, including the Big\\nBang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc.\\nIt does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere\\n\\'best fits\\' for the data. \\n\\n\\n\\nWell, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science\\nrequires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if\\nthe theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason.\\nDisbelievers are not punished. \\n\\n\\nThis is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_?\\nMy fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is\\nunable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God. \\n\\nYes, I know that one can\\'t believe without God\\'s help; Luther makes\\nthis quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I\\'m afraid this does not\\nchange my situation. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(deletions)\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy,\\neither something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody\\nwould ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but\\nactually no existing being could give an answer. \\n\\nImagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also\\nask: \"Why nothing exists?\" This is equivalent to my counter-question,\\n\"why nothing exists in nothingness\". \\n\\nNow, \"why anything exists\" is equivalent to \"why something exists in\\nsomethingness\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies\\nfor the poor wording in my previous post.\\n\\n\\nI do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence,\\nin general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still\\nleave open the question \"why this, and not that\", and this is where\\ntheistic explanations come in.\\n\\nScience cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being\\'s existence.\\n\\n\\nThis is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not?\\nAlso, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has\\nno meaning in His case. \\n\\nIf I am for a reason, I\\'ve yet failed to see what it would be. \\nFrom our perspective, it looks like \\'I\\' exist for truly random\\nreasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can\\nI believe there is any better reason for my existence?\\n\\n\\nYes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better.\\nMy 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have\\nto admit, but I am patient.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, it doesn\\'t, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists,\\nfor an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this\\nshould not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.\\n\\n\\nIt is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question \\n\"why do I exist, in particular\" is _not_ an invalid question - this\\nis not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to\\ntell, and I can\\'t just believe in any given explanation instead of\\nanother, especially since I found I was deluding myself. \\n\\n\\nI think \"pre-existence\" is an oxymoron. There is no time \\'outside\\' of\\nthis spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that \\nperspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who\\nare inside it. \\n\\n\\nNo. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think\\nphilosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not\\nknowable?\\n\\n\\nThis is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous\\nother questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base\\nmy faith on. \\n\\nI think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \"why do I believe\"\\nor \"why I don\\'t believe\". \\n\\nPetri\\n',\n",

              "  '\\n\\nThe argument for Luke\\'s genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\\nto Luke 3:23\\n\\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \\n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\\n   the son of Eli,\\n\\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\\nintention of tracing Mary\\'s genealogy (in which case he would have\\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband\\'s, from David\\'s son Nathan.\\n\\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David\\'s\\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\\n\\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \\n\\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\\nnot Jesus\\'s physical father, then the original poster is quite\\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus\\'s messianic heritage are not based on\\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus\\'s divine nature was.\\n\\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph\\'s seed in this\\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel\\'s dedication of\\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\\n\\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \\nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \\nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \\nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\\ndetails are described in Steiner\\'s \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \\nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\\nMatthew\". \\n\\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner\\'s methods and explanation are accepted\\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\\n\\nAs for the passing of one\\'s Jewishness through the mother, this was\\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary\\'s\\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\\nline of descent from David, the king.',\n",

One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\\n\\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \\nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\\n\\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\\n\\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\\n\\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\\n\\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\\n\\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\\nduuteranopia:\\n\\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \\n\\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour\\ndefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and\\nApplications 8(5) 28-40.\\n\\nYou will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not\\nfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.\\n\\n\\nYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red\\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\\nthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or\\nobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\\ncouple of weeks ago.\\n\\nThe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a\\nhelp here.)\\n\\nA) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you\\nhave the monitor data.\\nB) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'\\nusing u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)\\nC) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above\\nD) find the intersection as in step 3\\nE) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A\\nF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it\\nalong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and\\nwhite) until it is displayable.\\n\\n\\nDone; also posted for the rest of us.\\n\\n--\\nChris Lilley\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \\nManchester, UK.

              "  '\\nI agree, with the exception that I don\\'t preach ignoring our cultures.\\n\\n\\nIn Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one\\ncongregation in each major city.  So there was one unified church.  Now in\\neach city, there were people of different cultures.  Naturally, they\\nformed something of a stew, with different members having different\\nheritages.  Nevertheless, they were ONE body.  They met together,\\nsometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups\\nin places such as the temple courts.\\n\\nNow in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a\\ncommon language associated with that region.  For instance, in Rome, Latin\\nwas spoken.  In the United States today, English is spoken.  So it would\\nmake sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common\\nlanguage and not necessarily Latin.\\n\\nNaturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common\\nlanguage.  In the first century church, there were probably many people\\nin the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the\\nmessage for people of foreign ethnic groups.  Today, however, you don\\'t\\nsee people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called\\nPentacostal churches.  We do have a modern day equivalent though --\\nbi-lingual speakers.  Now in the unified church of which I am a member -\\nsometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meet\\ntogether on Sundays, there are headphones on people who don\\'t speak\\nEnglish from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their\\nnative tongue.  Neat idea, huh?\\n\\nNow, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays,\\nso sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish-\\nspeaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their\\nnative language.  In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times\\nduring the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals.  So someone\\nwho speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also\\nspeak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those\\nmeetings.\\n\\nAs for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch\\nwith their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep\\nfriendships among their church relationships with people of many various\\nnationalities.  \\n\\n\\nThe action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of\\nLatin?  Indeed not!  See my second paragraph in response to the second\\nclipping of your article.\\n\\nHowever, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a\\nculture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.\\n\\nI\\'ll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.\\n\\n\\nYou have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud\\nof their cultural heritages when most denominations didn\\'t.  Yet you have\\nlargely isolated yourselves from having quality \"Christian\" friendships\\noutside your nationality (and your denomination).\\n\\nWe shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their\\nheritage.  However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church\\nunity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.\\n\\n\\nIt sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going\\nabout things in the wrong way.  And names like the African Methodist\\nEpiscopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before.\\n\\nI understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such\\ngroups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  I know that it\\'s\\nhard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one\\nbody of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working to\\nmake it happen.  However, what might be a smaller step towards unity,\\nwould be taking the word \"African\" out of your denomination\\'s name.  Then\\nperhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the \"Methodist\\nEpiscopal\" part also, and simply be part of \"the Church\".\\n\\n\\nThere shall be one church, for the sake of unity, AND it shall be useful\\nin helping students new to America make the transition in culture,\\nlanguage, and thought.  We shouldn\\'t make a new denomination to try to\\nsolve problems.  The whole denominational mindset only causes more\\nproblems, sadly.  \\n\\n\\nThank you for the invitation.  That shows me that you indeed have the\\nheart to spread the gospel of Jesus as well as take part in your cultural\\nheritage.  Thank you also for responding to my post.  I know (all too well)\\nhow they can be very time-consuming.\\n\\nThe whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions,\\nbut I still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same\\ntime.  My own church, the Boston church, has the acapella singing that you\\nmentioned in your post, yet doesn\\'t limit expression of my Mexican\\nculture, even though I am in the MIT Campus ministry and not the Spanish\\n(speaking) Zone.  I have made a commitment to God that I will go to the\\nSunday services of my church, because I know that my brothers and sisters\\nhere are fully devoted in love for God as his disciples.\\n\\nI don\\'t believe in tongues, as you may have already picked up on, because\\nof my understanding of Biblical Christianity.  However, I am certainly\\nwilling to visit your congregation provided that it doesn\\'t interfere with\\nmy normal worship.  Since you also live in Cambridge, I also extend an\\ninvitation to you to visit our services as often as you like.  You can\\nmeet the MIT students at the Student Center (across from 77 Mass.

In many cases they consented, although they or their\\nfamilies are not of the Baptist faith.\\n\\nThe baptisms by the church have angered many parents, including\\nPaulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls\\nwho were baptized without her knowledge or consent.\\n\\n'My understnading was they were going to a carnival.  I feel that's a\\nfalse pretense,' said Lamontagne.  Her daughters said the minister\\ntold them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not\\nbaptized.\\n\\nCornerstone church officials defended their actions.\\n\\n'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commanded\\nus to baptize converts.  No one can show me one passage in the Bible\\nwhere it says that parental permission is required before a child is\\nbaptized,' said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist\\nChurch.\\n\\nChurch officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized\\nbecause 'they didn't ask,' Irwin said.\\n\\nMany other parents also felt they were simply sending their children\\nto a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who were\\nmembers of the Cornerstone Church.\\n\\nPolice said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the\\nchildren, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------\\nAren't these the same behaviors we condemn\\nin the Hari Krishnas and other cults?\\n\\n[I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account\\nmentions.  First, I'm not entirely sure that parental consent is\\nabsolutely required.  This would be extremely difficult, because of\\nthe clear commandment to obey parents.  But if an older child insisted\\non being baptized without their parents' consent, I might be willing\\nto do it.  However this would be a serious step, and would warrant\\nmuch careful discussion.  The problem I find here is not so much\\nparental consent as that there was nobody's consent.  Whether you\\nbelieve in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign\\nof entry into a Christian community.  If there isn't a commitment from\\n*somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of\\nthe Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it is\\nlikely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is from\\na baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, he\\nwould be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he already\\nhas been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.

              "  '\\nRight.  Most definitely.\\n\\n\\nThis may be the root of the confusion...\\n\\nPlease consider the following hypothetical with an open mind.  Note\\nthat I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the\\nquestion at hand.\\n\\nSuppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10\\nand win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population\\nof people who play this game every week.\\n\\nIn the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population\\nwill win 7 or more times.\\n\\nIn the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again\\nbe 7-time winners.\\n\\nIn the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in\\neach of the first two years will win 7 again.\\n\\nSuppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three\\nyears, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last\\nthree years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.\\n\\nDo we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?\\nNo.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these\\n\"consistent winners\" can influence their chances of winning.  But\\nsuppose we *don\\'t* know whether or not there is a chance that skill\\nmight be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are\\npsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?\\n\\nWe can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the\\npopulation will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a\\nhigh positive correlation (even if they aren\\'t very good psychics,\\nthey should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net\\nresult?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.\\n\\n\\nWell, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has\\nhit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at\\nthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse\\nas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn\\'t\\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\\n\\nNow if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true\\nto form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn\\'t\\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks\\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You\\nlook at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more\\nlikely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at\\nthose numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to\\nbe clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\\nway.\\n\\n\\nThen we would have something useful.  And we would also have a\\npositive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a\\npattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern\\nand then reverses.',\n",

              "  'This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to\\n_Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone\\ncomplained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the\\ncontrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads\\nis extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the\\nfamous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion.\\nThe letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that\\nNefertiti was \"a beautiful black queen.\"  This set off an exchange of\\nhotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had\\nan article from an Egyptologist titled \"Was Cleopatra Black?\"  (The answer\\nto the title is \"no\"-- she was greek.)\\n\\nI have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I\\npersonally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in\\nWash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary\\nenourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark\\nhair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and\\ndown the Mediterranean.\\n\\n(Also, if what I remember is correct, the \"Black Madonna\" doesn\\'t represent\\na person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe\\nBuehler....?)\\n\\nIn the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that\\ngreeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus,\\nthe situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians,\\nor various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about\\nthe Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then\\nthere are the Ethiopians....\\n\\nThose of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these\\npeople are \"white\" (i.e., of the racist\\'s \"race\").  If I may risk a\\npotentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the\\nidentification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering\\nthe extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval\\nantisemitism on the other, I don\\'t think that this \"Jesus was white\" thesis\\never played the roles that some hold it did.\\n\\nRepresentations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.

              "  'Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of\\napprox. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off\\nif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more\\nfuel to the flame!\\n\\n1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though\\nLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still\\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\\n\\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\\nand Berryhill couldn\\'t hit their way out of a wet cardboard\\nbox, and don\\'t walk enough to be useful.\\n\\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\\nat the start of the season, he wouldn\\'t have gotten his job back.\\n\\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\\nPlus, you\\'d have to eat that salary, which isn\\'t huge, but isn\\'t\\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson\\'s at about $800,000, Berryhill\\nat $450,000, but that\\'s only what I recall).\\n\\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\\naren\\'t eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\\n\\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn\\'t on the team.\\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\\nand the truth is that I\\'d rather see our best team on the field,\\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\\n\\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won\\'t need him. ;)\\n\\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\\nlike this:  (Remember, they\\'ve BOTH been GM\\'s)\\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\\n\\nCox:  OK, we\\'ve sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\\nis better than it used to be.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\\njust won\\'t sign that baseball only contract.  We can\\'t count\\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman\\'s not ready to give up on\\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher\\'s gone AND Deion signs,\\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\\n\\nCox:  Yep, that\\'ll be nice.  Too bad Deion won\\'t sign.\\nOK, I\\'ll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\\nKlesko?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ve still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\\nbut somehow he doesn\\'t seem to be the same GM.  First\\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I\\'d HAVE to believe that he\\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\\n\\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I\\'ll wait til the trading\\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\\nAnd if that doesn\\'t work, then perhaps Sid\\'s knees\\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There\\'s always the\\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\\n\\nCox:  Well, he\\'s not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\\nin Richmond, he\\'ll start walking more.  Besides, if he\\'s going to be\\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Now, let\\'s see.  That leaves Lopez.\\n\\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn\\'t think Olson\\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\\nrunning into him again?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he\\'ll get\\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson\\'s shown his stuff a little\\nbit, I can\\'t trade him.  Besides, Berryhill\\'s a left-handed\\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\\n\\nCox:  Don\\'t you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you\\'re the one who wouldn\\'t write Lopez\\ninto the lineup.\\n\\nCox:  Well, you\\'re the one who went out and got me Jeff\\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn\\'t be used\\nto our pitching staff\\'s stuff.  He got some time with\\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\\nwill be hurt by May.\\n\\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\\nTHE WORLD SERIES!

To him, he\\'s\\ngot to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than\\nwhere he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.\\nYou have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to\\nyou, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that\\nrisk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand\\nand listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because\\nhe is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,\\nhowever, he may not realise that he\\'s really putting you off.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\n\\nSo far, I\\'ve only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,\\nI do understand how you feel too, because I wasn\\'t a Christian for a good\\npart of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or\\n\"fundamentalists\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their\\nfaith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,\\n\"religious belief\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism\\nis also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is\\ninevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),\\nit will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both\\nsides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can\\ndo your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he\\'s\\ntrying to convince you about, that it\\'s beyond you or not your concern\\n\"for now\".  Don\\'t tell him it\\'s nonsense, because to him it is reality -\\nand that would be a real insult.  He\\'ll also have to be careful not to\\ninsult where you stand too.\\n\\nLike I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.\\nI\\'ll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a\\nChristian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little\\ndifferently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited\\nand just blabbered away about what I\\'ve found!  To me, it was too good\\nnot to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn\\'t really care most of\\nthe time what they thought.  You will probably think he\\'s crazy too -\\nbut God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in\\nmind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real\\nto him, he doesn\\'t see why God can\\'t be real to you too.\\n\\nI don\\'t know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow -\\nthis is quite a challenge for you to face.  By the way, personal\\nconviction: nobody is \"beyond saving\" except the one we call the \\ndevil and his hosts.',\n",

Image annotation software\\n=============================\\n\\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn\\'t normally stored\\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\\n  rasterfile.\\n\\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford\\'s InterViews distribution) can handle some\\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I\\'m not\\n  sure exactly what they are.\\n  You can ftp the idraw\\'s binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\\n\\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\\n\\nf. \\'ice\\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\\'s a PostScript-based\\n  graphical editor,and it\\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

I have some questions on this point:\\n\\n1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was \\npretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right\\nnow.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the\\n\"great judgement\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day).\\nI was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the\\nchurch -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \"soul\"\\n(which, by the way, I don\\'t believe in) exist until that time?\\n\\n2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms \\nthat my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My\\nphysical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my\\nnew body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal\\nso it can be tortured for all eternity?\\n\\n3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical\\nplace to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth?\\nDo you think we could find it if we dig?\\n\\nMark Schnitzius\\nschnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu\\nUniv. of Central Florida\\n\\n[There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I\\nthink the most common view is that final disposition does not occur\\nuntil a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the\\nmeantime, some believe that people \"sleep\" until the final\\nresurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death\\nto the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe\\nthat souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then.\\nThere are probably other alternatives that I\\'m omitting.\\n\\nThe new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a\\ndifferent \"technology\" than the current one, one which is not mortal.\\n(Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus\\'\\nresurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not\\nsubject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that\\nthere are enough similarities that people will recognize each other,\\nbut I don\\'t think most people claim to know the details.  I don\\'t\\nthink I\\'d say it\\'s the same atoms.  I\\'d assume there would be some\\nanalog of a physical place, but I wouldn\\'t expect to find it under the\\nearth or up in the sky.  I\\'d suspect that it\\'s in another dimension,\\noutside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little\\nin the way of details.',\n",

              "  'for SRC\\n\\nIn most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is\\nknown as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word\\nwhich comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning \"Passover.\" In English,\\nGerman, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER,\\nor some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the\\norigin of this term.\\n\\nOne explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE\\nRATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an\\nAnglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great\\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\\nnot make it more so.\\n\\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"Spring\\nFestival.\"\\n\\nHowever, Bede\\'s is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\\nKnoblech, in \"Die Sprach,\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\\n\\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\\nof the Resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week),\\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\\nreferred to simply as \"albae.\" Translaters rendering this into\\nGerman mistook it for the plural of \"alba,\" meaning \"dawn.\" They\\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\\n\"dawn.\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\\n\\n Yours,\\n James Kiefer\\n',\n",
              "  '\\n\\nI will answer this as I find time.\\n\\n\\nNotice what I said about this book.  I called it \"Easy reading.\"  The reason I\\ndropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical\\nSimon\\'s.  I don\\'t know how many walking encyclopedia\\'s I ran across in\\nphilosphy classes.  The problem isn\\'t in knowing sooooo much more than your\\naverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. \\nSchaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was\\nwritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was\\nto simple.  I\\'ve talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I\\'ve been in lectures with\\nthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof\\'s from secular\\nas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) \\nHis answers were enough that the prof\\'s themselves often were taken back and\\ncaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at\\ndifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,\\nsimplistic.  It certainly isn\\'t grad level reading.  But we must get off our\\nhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most\\npeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to\\nsay about this secular scientist at another time.\\n\\nAlso, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*\\ninquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt\\nbase.  \\n\\nLook, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must\\nadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in\\nkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know\\nits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust\\nit of all value!\\n\\nTHis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.\\n It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian\\nfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we\\nfly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic\\nlesson of life: \\n\\n\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\"  \\n\\nOr as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o\\nfreedom.\\n\\nLet\\'s put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to\\nabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the\\ndifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity\\'s contention with\\nrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very\\nlittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust\\ngo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called\\nto go on by itself without his understanding.\\n\\nThis is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the\\nChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment\\nand say, \"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\"  Now don\\'t read all\\nyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn\\'t saying I do not understand\\nyou at all, but I trust you anyway.\" It means that \"I do not understand You *in\\nthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\"  Therefore I can\\ntrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery\\nunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is\\na statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of\\nFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is\\nnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know\\nwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all\\nthe difference.\\n\\nNow, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted\\ncompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit\\nmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith\\nlike the insistent \"whying\" of a 3 year old.  It isn\\'t just that we would like\\nto know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot\\nknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other\\nleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in\\ncoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after\\ncoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need\\nto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp\\nthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may\\ncount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  \\n\\nIf, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust\\nhim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian\\nleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which\\nallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be\\nambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to\\nus, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.\\nAnd that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in\\npractice.   ',\n",

It\\'s pretty unusual to see significant\\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\\ntext.  That\\'s because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don\\'t think there\\'s\\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don\\'t think there\\'s\\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\\nit has much practical effect.\\n\\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\\nthat don\\'t affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\\nall the versions.  I\\'m surprised to find a reference to this on the\\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I\\'ve been\\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.

Having\\nstudied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one\\nstage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying\\ntheological meaning in the judgement prophesies.

The \"false prophets\" understood their relatioship\\nto God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is\\npossible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,\\nwhich was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David\\'s\\ndescendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part\\nof the Lord to keep a descendant of David\\'s upon the throne and to never\\nallow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a\\nJudahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly\\nbeen Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the\\ntheological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel\\nthrough Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant\\nafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the\\nlocal prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic\\ncovenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah\\nspoke his prophesies. The \"judgement prophesies\" were deeply loaded with\\ntheological meaning.\\n\\nIn my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson\\n\"New York will burn\" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic\\ntheological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.\\n\\n--\\n                                                                     ___\\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---',\n",

You\\'re missing a central teaching of Christianity -\\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\\nwho consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head\\ntheir own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, \\'Lord, Lord,\\' will\\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\\nis in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.\\n\\n\\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?

No one can browbeat you\\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God\\'s\\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\\nsome people it did comprise their life\\'s writings, so I am hardly in a\\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.

HL}\\n\\nThe standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents \\nis probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, \"Hermeneutrik und \\nKritik,\" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of\\n_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:\\nBeck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The \\nProphetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).\\n(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley\\ndescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little\\nknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject\\nand the reader.)  Nibley\\'s extract from Blass\\'s work is in the form\\nof \"rules for forgers.\"  It makes interesting reading.\\n\\nI confess that I have not read Blass\\'s work, only Nibley\\'s extract\\nthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and\\nas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,\\nI believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that \\nany competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient\\ndocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one \\nwould expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not \\nbe able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to \\ndetermine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and \\nculture or is a later forgery.\\n\\nActually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:\\n\\n1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example\\nthe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific\\nmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found\\nwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual\\nphysical objects.\\n\\n2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the\\ncopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a\\ndocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something\\nfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several\\ngenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still \\nbe tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot\\nexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so\\nwe must confine our testing to the text itself.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if\\nthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the\\ndocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I\\'ve heard\\nof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king\\nin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up\\nscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the\\nholograph).  They could check the language, content and writing\\nstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a\\nPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were\\npositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually\\nwrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but\\n(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for \\ncomparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to\\ndetermine who the actual author was.\\n\\nAs I say, I\\'m no expert on Blas\\'s work.  I do remember some of the\\ntests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  \\nSpecifically we might ask:\\n\\n1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict\\nitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to \\nmaintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.

Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.

              "  'continuing part #4 (I think); used by permission,\\n\\nTHE SOURCE AND NT MEANING\\nOF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS\\nFOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY\\n\\n                                      James B. DeYoung\\n\\nW. Petersen\\n\\n     More recently Wright\\'s understanding has itself been questioned from a\\ndifferent direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic\\nconfusion in using the English word \"homosexuals\" as the meaning of\\narsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for\\nrendering it by \"homosexuals\" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.\\n\\n     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a\\nsingle assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds\\n\"homosexuals\" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  \"A\\nmajor disjunction\" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the\\nthought and terminolgy in Paul\\'s time (187-88).\\n\\n      What is this \"disjunction\"?  He bases it on historical and linguistic\\nfacts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as\\npolyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. \\nVirtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. \\nChristianity simply added the categories of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" in\\ndescribing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of\\n\"homosexuals\" and \"heterosexuals,\" and assumed that, in the words of Dover\\nquoted approvingly by Petersen, \"everyone responds at different times to both\\nhomosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . .\" (188). [23]\\n\\n      In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term \"homosexual\"\\nto desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term\\nequivalent to \"homosexual,\" used it as referring to orientation, impluse or\\naffectional preference and having \"nothing to do with sexual acts\" (189).\\n\\n     Petersen then proceeds to cite the \"Supplement to the Oxford English\\nDictionary,\"  which defines \"homosexual\" only as a propensity or desire with no\\nmention of acts.  Petersen\\'s point is that by using \"homosexuals\" for\\narsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history\\n\"where no equivalent concept existed\" (189).  Consequently the translation is\\ninaccurate because it \"includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes\\nfemale homosexuals\" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no \"cognitive structure,\\neither inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of\\nhumanity into \\'homosexuals\\' and \\'hetersosexuals\\' made sence\" (189).\\n\\n     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio\\n\"homosexual\" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one\\nmistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The next\\nphases of this paper will critically examine Petersen\\'s position.\\n\\n                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING\\n                          ARSENOKOITAI BY \"HOMOSEXUALS\"\\n\\nHistorical Grounds\\n\\n     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai\\nby \"homosexuals\" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Since\\nvirtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul\\'s\\nusage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writing\\nreveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary\\nwith Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of\\nhomosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to\\npresent-day concepts.  \\n\\n     Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual\\ncondition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be\\npart of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the term\\nis limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes; \\nScroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient\\ntimes (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither of\\nthese positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion\\nfirst with the former one being addressed below under \"Linguistic Grounds.\"\\n\\n     In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the\\nhomosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if\\nit is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including\\nancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. \\nIndeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only\\nknew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of\\nsame-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex\\norientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in\\n\"Symposium\" (189d-192d) may be a \"sole possible exception\" to ancient\\ningnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that even\\nhere \"acts appear to be the deciding factor.\"  However, this is a very\\nsignificant exception, hardly worthy of being called \"an exception,\" because of\\nthe following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.\\n\\n     THe \"Symposium\" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for\\nknowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sex\\ncomprised of a maile-female (androgynon (\"man-woman\"). Hence \"original nature\"\\npalai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced these\\nhuman beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the\\ngods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the\\nopposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:\\n\\n    Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like\\n    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever\\n    searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections\\n    of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are \\n    woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,\\n    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.\\n    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:\\n    they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.\\n    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as \\n    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by\\n    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be\\n    clasped in men\\'s embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,\\n    for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless\\n    creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness\\n    but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome\\n    their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity\\n    these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come\\n    to man\\'s estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in\\n    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of\\n    custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.\\n    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the \\n    willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when\\n    one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort- \\n    happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously \\n    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be \\n    induced to leave each other\\'s side for a single moment.  These are\\n    they who continue together throughout life, though they could not\\n    even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25]\\n\\nShould these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as\\nlong as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each \"would\\nunreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all\\nthe time:  (192e).\\n\\n     Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism is\\ncontemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  \"Natural interest\" (ton\\nnoun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. \\nThe words, \"born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: \\n(paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims \"to\\nbe born this,\" i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity (\"the two of them\\nare wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love,\" 192b) is\\npresent.  Aristophanes even speaks of \"mutual love ingrained in mankind\\nreassembling our early estate\" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai\\ntes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency (\"These are\\nthey who continue together throughout life,\" 102c) is also present.  Further\\nmention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, \"gay pride,\" pederasty,\\nhomophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is\\nrecognizable.\\n\\n    Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from\\nactions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is\\ncrucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). \\nThey mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are tow\\nkinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its \"desire\" and \"passion\"\\n(186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or \"matters\" of love (187c), the\\ndesires of love (192c) and being \"males by nature\" (193c).  Noteworthy is the\\nspeech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is\\nrelated to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for \"what is not\\nprovided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack.\"  This is\\nthe object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between \"what\\nsort of being is love\" and the \"works\" of love (201e).  This ancient\\nphilosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of\\nbeing or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]\\n\\n     In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and\\nhomosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in error\\nwhen he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not\\ninclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the\\nlatter. [27]\\n\\n     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where\\nhomosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  In\\nRom 1:21-28 such phrases as \"reasoning,\" \"heart,\" \"becoming foolish,\" \"desires\\nof the heart.\" and \"reprobate mind\" prove Paul\\'s concern for disposition and\\ninclination along with the \"doing\" or \"working\" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). \\nEven the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor\\n6:9-11) by words describing what people \"are\" or \"were,\" not what they \"do.\" \\nHabits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt.\\n23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise\\nto the other (cf. Mt 5:27).\\n\\n     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparently\\nwas accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian,\\npeople of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only a\\nfew moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example,\\nSeneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an\\nadult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes to\\nsome length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women\\n(The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he\\njustifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchange\\nof clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).\\n\\n     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the\\n\"new labels\" of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" for sexual behavior.  These did not\\nbegin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even\\nnon-Christian contemporaries used them.  Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu,\\nPlutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29]\\n\\nLinguistic Grounds',\n",

The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`~sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\n|details-start|\\n**Usage**\\n|details-split|\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\n|details-end|\\n\\n|details-start|\\n**Converting text to vectors**\\n|details-split|\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\\nfrom a subset of 20news::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n  >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n  ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> vectors.shape\\n  (2034, 34118)\\n\\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\\n  159.01327...\\n\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which\\nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\\n\\n|details-end|\\n\\n|details-start|\\n**Filtering text for more realistic training**\\n|details-split|\\n\\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try the\\n:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\nexample with and without the `remove` option to compare the results.\\n|details-end|\\n\\n.. topic:: Data Considerations\\n\\n  The Cleveland Indians is a major league baseball team based in Cleveland,\\n  Ohio, USA. In December 2020, it was reported that \"After several months of\\n  discussion sparked by the death of George Floyd and a national reckoning over\\n  race and colonialism, the Cleveland Indians have decided to change their\\n  name.\" Team owner Paul Dolan \"did make it clear that the team will not make\\n  its informal nickname -- the Tribe -- its new team name.\" \"It\\'s not going to\\n  be a half-step away from the Indians,\" Dolan said.\"We will not have a Native\\n  American-themed name.\"\\n\\n  https://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-team-name-change\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  - When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n    should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this\\n    by setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n    lower because it is more realistic.\\n  - This text dataset contains data which may be inappropriate for certain NLP\\n    applications. An example is listed in the \"Data Considerations\" section\\n    above. The challenge with using current text datasets in NLP for tasks such\\n    as sentence completion, clustering, and other applications is that text\\n    that is culturally biased and inflammatory will propagate biases. This\\n    should be taken into consideration when using the dataset, reviewing the\\n    output, and the bias should be documented.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_hashing_vs_dict_vectorizer.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_clustering.py`\\n'}"
